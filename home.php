                        <p>Written by Grant Morrison. Art and cover by Dave McKean In celebration of the 16th anniversary of the critically 
                            acclaimed Batman story that helped launch the U.S. careers of Grant Morrison and Dave McKean, DC Comics is proud 
                            to present a softcover edition of the Arkham Asylum Anniversary Edition, reprinting the now-classic confrontation 
                            between the Dark Knight and his archnemeses the Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and more in the black heart 
                            of Gotham City&#39;s house for the criminally insane.
