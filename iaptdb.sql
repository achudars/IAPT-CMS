After seeing it introduced at Gamescom in Germany in 2011 and being one of the very first people outside of Sony and developer Fun Bits Interactive to play it, I quickly realized the incredible potential of the game. Needless to say, it turned out well.<br /><br />\r\nAs such, would-be PlayStation 4 owners and skeptical gamers alike may have heard about Escape Plan since it launched on Vita nearly two years ago. A puzzler oozing with quirkiness, charm and style, my time with the PS4 port likewise proved to be quite fun. But Escape Plan also finds itself saddled with a handful of problems that hold it back from what it could have been -- namely some finicky controls -- even if the transition from Vita’s touch screen to PS4’s DualShock 4 is surprisingly well-executed.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat\'s most noticeable about Escape Plan is its beautiful black-and-white graphics. With the exception of some red in the logo, you\'ll see nothing but grayscale anywhere else in the entire game. Main characters Lil and Laarg are an adorable tandem that really pop and stick out. In fact, the entire game can easily be described as gorgeous, with a special attention paid to a unique aesthetic that contributes greatly to the overall feel. Complementing the art style is an almost ironic classical music score and other sonic accompaniment, including laugh, gasp and clap tracks pulled straight out of your favorite \'80s sitcom.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEscape Plan revolves around the aforementioned Lil and Laarg, two characters with different body builds who are attempting to flee from the evil clutches of the devious mastermind named Bakuki. Our two heroes hatch their escape plans over and over again throughout 78 rooms. Each room is its own puzzle, and the puzzles themselves are strewn across four different environments that all admittedly look the same as one another. Expect to die often in Escape Plan; death is actually considered instructive, though, because you\'ll know exactly what you did wrong so you don\'t do it again. Then again, the game does tease you by cleverly (and maniacally) putting the number of times each character dies directly on their chest. Y\'know, just so you don\'t forget.<br /><br />\r\nMost of the puzzles have one single idea behind them, though various solutions can be found in certain situations. On Vita, Escape Plan is controlled largely by touch, but that’s obviously not possible on PS4. Thankfully, DualShock 4 makes for an excellent replacement, with an all-new cursor controlled by analog stick, and various functions once relegated to Vita’s front and back touch pads mapped to R2, X, and more. I was skeptical about how a game so obviously made for Vita would port to PS4, but it’s just as solid on console as it is on handheld. Still, it shares some of the same problems as the Vita version, mainly in the form of various controls that don\'t always work consistently.<br /><br />\r\nEach puzzle is solved when Lil and/or Laarg successfully leaves the room in question without perishing. But just how do the puzzles themselves play out? Well, one puzzle might have you tap a coffee machine to have Lil drink out of it, thus giving him super speed and the ability to dodge danger with his quickness. Another puzzle might have you insert Laarg into a bubble and then control him by swiping on the front touch pad while avoiding razor blades and spikes.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere\'s great variety in the puzzles -- from simple and clean to long and complicated -- though certain conventions are reused as the campaign goes on. Still, completing puzzles, progressing further into the quest, and earning the coveted perfect three-star rating is exceptionally rewarding, though how long it\'ll take to beat is wholly based on your skill level. Expect to spend at least three or four hours with Escape Plan at minimum.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEscape Plan absolutely reeks of nonsense and humor, which is exactly what you\'d expect from a team partially comprised of the squad that brought PlayStation Network gamers Fat Princess. Appropriately priced for PS4 (and completely free-of-charge if you already own it on Vita, with a separate Trophy list to boot), Escape Plan is a worthy purchase, especially if you\'re looking for a pick-up-and-play game that can be digested very slowly, one morsel at a time. I just hope Fun Bits Interactive gets a crack at a sequel one day, because Escape Plan could use a few control fixes, and can easily be better than just great.',1386325127,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/05/escapeplan120413coverjpg-885b21_948w.jpg','published','review_article',1),(93,'THIS MUST BE IN PLAYSTATION','test column articletest column article',1386281341,'test column article','rejected','column_article',0),(94,'WARFRAME PLAYSTATION 4 REVIEW','Make your own fun. This was once the mantra of the creative kid in the boring backyard; now it’s a pitch well-suited for Warframe. There’s nothing openly exciting about where its repetitive mission designs take you, but the huge variety of weapons, powers, and combat suits lets your creativity open up the battlefield to fun experimentation — that is, if you’re willing to pay.<br /><br />\r\nWarframe is a free-to-play, third-person, co-op shooter in the vein of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but with approximately 250 percent more ninjas wearing sci-fi suits (the titular warframes). The starter suits offer plenty of variety right from the get-go: one, Excalibur, is a well-balanced set that’s a good starting point for beginners. Another, the Loki set, lets you trick enemies with decoys and turn invisible in an instant. It feels especially sneaky and manipulative in a rewarding way. Each of these suits function as entirely different characters, and each is fun and challenging to play with.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, these sleek, awesome warframe-ninjas you play as? They fight mean aliens. That’s about as deep as the story dives, unfortunately. Relative to other co-op centric shooters like Left 4 Dead and Borderlands that use characters and humor so well, something important feels missing. But of course, that doesn’t really reduce the effectiveness of Warframe’s action-heavy gameplay, or the pleasure that comes from slicing and shooting its variety of faceless and disposable enemies, including riflemen, shield carriers, and napalm launchers. Why am I killing these guys? Who cares. Now excuse me while I power-slide down a hill, flip into the air, and fire an arrow into a dude’s head before I land.<br /><br />\r\nThe most glaring issue I faced as a new player is that Warframe doesn’t explain things well enough. Suits need to be modded with abilities, but the menus are unintuitive. Sometimes slotting a new power works fine, but other times the screen flashes red but doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. The interstellar mission-select screen is also unhelpful, as it doesn’t show you at a glance which planets have missions that are unlocked and ready for you to begin, forcing you to click on each one to track them down.<br /><br />\r\nIt also doesn’t put much care into making missions feel distinct. They include the following: killing things and then blow up a reactor, killing things and then rescuing a person, killing things and then killing a boss, etc. Point is, though they’re different in name, most of Warframe’s dozens of levels feel exactly the same. Follow the dot on the minimap, shoot or stab the things that reside there, and then keep going. However, because the combat is so much fun I didn’t mind replaying levels multiple times to conquer them in different ways.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith a party of four players, it’s wise to think about team composition – especially in more difficult stages. Like in most MMORPGs, a healer and a front-line tank prove essential for most hectic fights. Cutting through hordes of enemies with a well-rounded team is fast, fun and satisfying. Playing a level alone, meanwhile, is a big change of pace. Because you take a massive cut in firepower, it’s more important to earn stealth kills and avoid alarms. I played through one area crouched with a bow and a glaive, then I played it again with a shotgun and fiery area attacks. You have complete control over the pacing of combat, which feels welcome and invigorating in a shooter.<br /><br />\r\nThe biggest draw of Warframe lies in using the variety of suits, weapons, and other gear. This introduces a huge caveat – Warframe is a free-to-play game, and its in-game purchases can get very, very expensive. There are over a dozen warframes for sale, as well as dozens of other weapons, drones, and modifications. If you want a small selection of characters and only a few weapons to swap between them, you’ll end up dropping a full $60 on Warframe in no time. The in-game currency is earned too slowly to be rewarding; after four hours of play I was still at level one and I hadn’t accrued enough money to buy even the cheapest of suits. Rewards earned from playing normally feel purposely stunted, and it’s very disappointing for a game that could’ve kept me hooked long enough to fall in love with it (and throw money at it) with a little enticement.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe store itself could also be more transparent. For example, I bought a sniper rifle with real money. When I used it in a game, the reticle was so full of lines, dots, and other crap that I could hardly see what I was supposed to shoot. A preview option would\'ve been handy, especially when things are so expensive.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTHE VERDICT<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWarframe tips the scales too far in one direction. The core gameplay, including the variety of suits and weapons, is terrific, and it’s reason enough to play this sci-fi shooter. But the boring story, too-similar missions, and aggressive payment model hold it back from what it could be. Still, if you plan to pick it up, it’s worth dropping $60 and pretend there’s nothing else to it.',1386320491,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/12/warframe1600.jpg','published','review_article',0),(95,'SUPER MOTHERLOAD','As man looks towards the stars to begin lucrative mining operations in space at a faster rate than you might think, game designers here on Earth have crafted a product that has you doing just that.

Indeed, the entire experience is predicated on a simple and repetitious – yet fairly engaging – premise, one that could prove to be addictive if not for Super Motherload’s unfortunate frustrations and maddening ending.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nDIGGING THE MYSTERY.<br /><br />\r\nSUBMIT TWEET SHARE +1 SHARE<br /><br />\r\nReviewed on PlayStation 4<br /><br />\r\n&#8594; NOVEMBER 21, 2013 As man looks towards the stars to begin lucrative mining operations in space at a faster rate than you might think, game designers here on Earth have crafted a product that has you doing just that. Super Motherload, from fledgling developer XGen Studios, sends us delving deep into the Martian surface to find precious minerals and gems to exchange for cold, hard cash. Indeed, the entire experience is predicated on a simple and repetitious – yet fairly engaging – premise, one that could prove to be addictive if not for Super Motherload’s unfortunate frustrations and maddening ending.<br /><br />\r\nCan you dig it?<br /><br />\r\nCan you dig it?<br /><br />\r\nAfter selecting your character, you’re given a mining rover that can be used to dig ever deeper into Mars’ randomly generated red soil. It’s at this point that – from the very beginning -- you see virtually everything Super Motherload has to offer, from graphics to gameplay. And that’s okay, because on a mechanical level, it does what it does very well, even if it looks old and, on the periphery, quite unimpressive. Controlling your rover is simple, with movement mapped to either the directional pad or left analog stick, and digging is as simple as moving in the direction you want to excavate. The X button is used to float and fly back to areas above you, making sure you’re never stranded in the bowels of the planet.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs you dig, you’ll encounter metals and precious gems of all kinds, from cheap silver and gold to pricey diamonds and rubies, which makes you want to keep digging, since the further down you get, the more common valuable rocks become. Bringing these back to service checkpoints, of which there are several as you move your way deeper and deeper, allows you to exchange your findings for money, which can then be used to upgrade your rover’s capabilities in fairly granular ways. You can increase your fuel capacity, better your drill bit, strengthen your armor, and much, much more. In this sense, Super Motherload has all of the trappings of something addictive, especially when you combine it with its rudimentary story – complete with passable voice acting – and pleasing soundtrack.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nUnfortunately, though, Super Motherload becomes monotonous before very long. While there’s something intriguing about the experience -- something that caters to the OCD gamer in me that wants to dig up every last mineral and upgrade every little thing – it’s decidedly a one-trick pony. Digging down until your fuel is depleted, having to go back to the last station to refuel and deposit your findings, and then doing it all over again isn’t only the core of Super Motherload. It is Super Motherload.<br /><br />\r\nThings do get changed up a bit when you take into account your rover’s upgradeable smelter, which lets you combine minerals and gems to create more expensive items, explosives, and more. Likewise, finally passing through harder, more impervious soil types, rocks, and other materials that require better drill bits and bombs is strangely rewarding. But even with multiple characters’ rovers to upgrade, a few different endings to experience, and even local multiplayer to jump into, Super Motherload does very little to outright recommend it.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnd then there’s the last boss battle. Oh, that completely deflating last boss battle! For some reason, an arcade-style digging game culminates with a final encounter that borders on the infuriating. A six-to-eight hour campaign that revolves around doing the same thing over and over again suddenly decides it wants you to fight, and fight hard.

It’s a serviceable arcade game that provides its own share of fun, but it’s also repetitive – occasionally gratingly so – with a façade of robust customization options hiding the fact that we’re doing the same thing over and over again underneath. Outside of scratching that compulsive upgrade-cycle itch and a catchy soundtrack, it’s not really worth digging into.',1386325144,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/SuperMotherload_112113_1600.jpg','published','column_article',1),(96,'THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD','When fleeing from a pack of cops at 150mph through a forest after midnight, I found it difficult not to be excited by Need for Speed: Rivals – and then a helicopter’s searchlight pours in through the trees for an additional adrenaline kick. Those initial potent highs aren’t sustainable, though, and after a while I was left wishing for just a bit more variety and depth to keep the thrills coming beyond simply doing the same thing online. That said, I still found it an exciting, highly polished experience, which appealed to both to the racer and more casual thrill-seeker in me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloped by Ghost Games, Rivals feels like the natural successor to the work of previous NFS developer Criterion. (Unsurprising really consider the majority of the staff went over to the new studio.) It combines Hot Pursuit’s cops-versus-racer dynamic with the freeform gameplay of Most Wanted’s open world. In many ways it’s the best of both, although if you’ve played either of those a great deal, as I have, you may get a feeling of déja vu from Rivals.<br />\r\nRivals takes place in the fictional Redview County, which has probably the most diverse geography imaginable. Within the confines of its map you can take in parched deserts and lush vineyards, upmarket seaside promenades and snowy mountain passes. It provides a welcome change of pace after the urban sprawl of Most Wanted, though I came to really miss those concrete labyrinths when I was outrunning the cops.<br />\r\nBut it’s ultimately a tradeoff, with Redview’s long, winding roads setting the stage for some truly operatic chases that go on for miles. They’re better suited for drifting and pushing fast cars to their limits, like Hot Pursuit, instead of outfoxing the cops and hiding like in Most Wanted. It’s all about the ballet of the chase. It’s a shame there wasn’t room in this world for both play styles, as it would’ve given us more variety to play with. And very occasionally, I did find myself being spotted by the cops even though I’d seemingly given them the slip, which was slightly frustrating.<br />\r\nEach stretch of road is crammed with various challenges, including standard races and time trials, new cars to shut down, and records to smash. But for all of its gorgeous scenery, I found Redview a slightly less fun and secret-filled place to explore. There are no billboards bearing your friends’ faces to crash through, no super cars squirrelled away, and fewer jumps than previous games. And while there are a few hidden pathways to be found and the possibility of going off-road occasionally, I also found myself more frequently attempting to head off the beaten path only to be put back into place by an officious barrier. Most Wanted encouraged you to explore its train tunnels and jump off rooftops, but Rivals keeps you firmly on track.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRivals is fantastically pretty, making great use of your next-gen console or PC. Cars look brilliant, near photorealistic. But Need for Speed has always had a slightly heightened approach to its presentation, and that’s still the case. Its cars are noisy creatures, always ready to race – look closely and you’ll see beads of moisture dripping down the bodywork, as if the car’s physically exerted itself. Weather effects are equally impressive. Rain, sun, and snow – as well as the time of day – have a big impact on the look of the game. Torrential downpours clog up the screen, while sometimes at night you’ll flashes of lightning illuminated the highly-textured road surface. And while it may not be the most densely populated of landscapes, there’s always something to catch the eye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story is intentionally incidental. (We’re a long way from the narrative pretensions of the woeful NFS: The Run.) Whether cop or racer, each chapter is structured around a speed list, which is little more than a series of objects. Rivals is eager to get you behind the wheel and onto the tarmac, giving a welcomed sense of urgency, and one of the best things about it is the ease with which you can switch between playing as a cop or a racer.<br />\r\nHot Pursuits – high-speed races with the cops already on your tail – are definitely the pick of the available events. Time trials and races lose their appeal much quicker, especially after you’ve already driven down the same stretch of road countless times.<br />\r\nRivals is tremendous fun, for a while, but once I got to grips with its weapons, unlocked more of its ridiculous cars, and became intimately acquainted with the map, it didn’t have a lot more to really show me. The map is fairly big but when you’re driving at such high speeds, it’s easy to see a big chunk of it in a single pursuit. It definitely continued to excite me, but stopped surprising me quite early on.<br />\r\nNo matter which side of the law you choose, there’s a garage full of high-powered super cars ranging from Aston Martins to Ferraris waiting for you. Handling is fun, responsive, and accessible – even newcomers will soon be able to slide around tight corners with a little practice. There’s also the option to soup them up, with high-tech gadgetry including spike strips and mines, shockwave blasts, and knuckle-whitening turbo boosts. None of the weapons are particularly memorable or iconic, and while they’re useful, you can’t really beat old-fashioned ramming.<br />\r\nIt’s all in the pursuit of unlocking upgrades, and it’s definitely more fun when playing as a racer. There’s more customisation and better toys, such as the preposterous turbo boost, and the way in which you accumulate points is much more engrossing. There’s a simple but effective risk-reward dilemma at play, baiting you to keep racing to build your score multiplier – but if you’re busted, you lose everything. The feeling of being pursued by a six police Ferraris when you’ve got in excess of 100,000 points at risk is when Rivals is at its very best. By comparison, playing as a cop just feels a little staid.<br />\r\nIf nothing else, being a cop becomes a more attractive proposition when it’s your friends that need busting. Structurally, Rivals’ multiplayer becomes a seamless part of its single-player experience, allowing up to six players to race with or against each other in the same world. You can all be cops, hunting down AI racers, or run from the fuzz together, or even a mixture of the two. You can go head-to-head or do your own thing, until the map brings you together. There are no rules, and it’s enjoyably freeform, though perhaps the size of the map and relatively small number of players allowed is slightly at odds (but somewhat fixed by using fast travel to meet up). Also, for the sake of balance and fairness, it takes much longer to wreck an opponent\'s car. I also missed some of Most Wanted’s more imaginative multiplayer objectives, like who can pull the longest donut.

I mean, look at it. Look. At. It. Here is a game whose visuals are so beautifully realistic that you almost have to stop and try it, regardless of how much you like basketball. Not since Fight Night Round 3 in 2006 has a sports game lured me in with its stunning graphics and kept me hooked with rock-solid gameplay the way NBA 2K14 is capable of doing. Only the new set of modes unique to this version of the game, which differ but don’t quite deliver on their full potential, keep next-gen 2K14 from dethroning its cousin.<br />\r\nLaudably, the new 2K14 and its smart AI and NBA-accurate pacing plays almost exactly like the excellent 360 and PS3 version -- complete with this year’s new Assist Pass and improved dribbling controls. That’s a disappointment to anyone hoping for a whole new experience from the new generation of consoles, but it’s hard to complain that it plays like one of the best basketball games ever. I only have a couple of issues. First, the ball behaves like its own physics object now, and seemingly because of that it ends up loose or bouncing off a guy’s back more often than it should in a game about pro ball players. Also, though the players look and feel noticeably more planted to the court and less floaty than we’re used to, I still occasionally caught someone magnetizing over to his nearby assignment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then there’s the obvious: NBA 2K14 is sexy. But why? Running 1080p resolution at a smooth 60 frames per second on both consoles establishes a gorgeous foundation, but it’s the attention to detail -- always a calling card of this series but dialed up an extra notch here -- that guarantees you rubbernecking roommates anytime you play it. The players -- and for the first time, coaches -- look convincingly realistic. More importantly, they move that way too. Animations both big and small -- everything from myriad dunks to Ray Allen’s smirk when he nails a big three-pointer -- sell the realism, as does 2K14’s array of lifelike facial animations. The players look alive -- it’s not quite a T-1000 level of convincing, but it’s damn impressive.<br />\r\nRounding out the impeccable broadcast-style presentation, the usual Kevin Harlan-led commentary crew is as on-point as ever, but the addition of sideline reporter Doris Burke’s interviews with a player or coach at halftime and the end of the game -- where you hear a contextually accurate real-life voice clip, lip-synched and all -- is something I can’t help but be impressed by.<br />\r\nThe biggest graphical sin is when something goes visually awry in a game that looks so amazing -- for instance, one of the infrequent but far-from-rare clipping bugs -- because it really, really stands out, like a glitch in The Matrix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough it bears the same name, NBA 2K14 on next-gen is, in fact, a totally different package than the one that released in October for PS3 and Xbox 360. Instead of the LeBron Path to Greatness and Crews, the next-gen version introduces several new modes (and a refreshingly simplified redesign of the menus). Notably, MyCareer has you create a player and take him through a everything from a pre-draft showcase to Draft Night to working your way up from benchwarmer to starter. It’s loaded with fully acted cutscenes and played-up drama, and much of it is laughably cheesy. Neither the dialogue nor the voice acting can ever be taken seriously, and when you get accosted by an angry DeMarcus Cousins (since I was drafted by the Kings) after a game for not getting him the ball, it’s especially jarring when he’s a mute who speaks only in subtitles.<br />\r\nMyGM is a fresh, considered take on the age-old franchise mode. You control everything from roster moves to coaching staff to budget to hot dog and merchandise prices, and you have to keep your owner, coaches, players, fans, and the media happy along the way. It’s deep and gets rather engrossing, though you won’t earn many GM-related unlocks (such as influence in contract negotiations) unless you go in and play the games yourself, which adds a ton of time to a mode that should allow me to focus on the off-court parts of the NBA if I want to.<br />\r\nAnd Park is an evolution of the Blacktop mode from NBA 2K on 360 and PS3; in this incarnation, up to 100 players on each server can either play or be waiting for the next game in either 2-on-2 halfcourt, three-quarters-court 3-on-3, or full-court 5-on-5, all with custom-created MyCareer hoopsters. The three-on-three is the sweet spot for me, as everyone gets involved enough (including on-mic trash talk) without the streakiness that a 2-on-2 halfcourt match is prone to or the chaos of a 5-on-5 showdown. But it needs more structure; you can’t form crews or leagues, or otherwise conveniently meet up and play together unless you coordinate externally through your console’s Friends list.',1386320936,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/11/12/nbs2k141108131600jpg-885094.jpg','published','basic_article',0),(98,'DC UNIVERSE ONLINE','Calling all super-heroes! Nearly three years after its launch on PC and PlayStation 3, DC Universe Online is flying higher than ever. Now released on PlayStation 4, this action-packed online RPG has grown beefier, free-er, and sharper thanks to a modest graphics makeover. It’s still mostly the same game as it was when we first reviewed it, though, so if you weren’t a fan of grinding through legions of heroes and villains to gain experience, earn super-loot, and hang out with the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman, then this revamped edition may still leave you Captain Cold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGetting started with DC Universe Online on PS4 is easy, especially if you’ve been playing on the PS3. It shares the same servers, so all you need to do is log in with your PSN account and your existing toons will follow. For newcomers, though, character creation is a comic fans dream come true. Designing a custom hero or villain from scratch or using an existing DC character as a template offers a dizzying array of possible combinations, naturally falling into the MMO roles of tank, controller, and healer. Be warned, though, that three years in, all the good hero and villain names have been taken so you may be stuck with adding numbers or being really creative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on real-time combat instead of the auto-fighting that prevailed in older MMOs, DC Universe Online’s fun fighting system hasn’t changed much since launch. Expect to punch guys a lot in the beginning since your early powers tend to be less powerful than your fists. Character animations are stilted and the lack of variety in henchmen, cops, and goons can get a bit tiresome. The controls are practically identical to those on PS3, and it’s fairly easy to implement multiple powers using a combination of the shoulder bumpers and main buttons.<br />\r\nAs you level up, things get cooler as you add skills and powers from the expansive skill tree. Unfortunately, the progression trees can be too limited, and sometimes ask that you choose powers you don’t want or don’t make sense for your character’s backstory in order to get the one you actually want.<br />\r\nMany of the story quests are personally assigned by DC’s iconic characters like Batman and Joker, which really makes you feel like an important part of this comic-book world and not just another guy in a cape. Open-world quests tend to be pretty grindy and monotonous, usually ordering you to collect or defeat a particular number of items or enemies. Much more interesting are instanced dungeon encounters that climax each story arc, in which you fight alongside superpowered elite like The Flash or take down major villains like Poison Ivy.<br />\r\nFinishing all the main storyline content should cap out your character at level 30. If you’re mainly a solo player, there’s not much for you to do after that except to replay missions or restart a new character, but the more social-minded now have access to an excess of exciting endgame content like story-based raids, co-op encounters, and PvP battles that incorporate DC’s big-name characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDC Universe Online has grown in complexity thanks to a steady stream of updates and purchasable DLC packs. The new crafting system, which lets you create power-giving exobytes and slot them into your armor and equipment, is dead simple. That’s good, because beefing up your gear increases your Combat Rating; a high rating grants access to some of the most exciting top tier raids and encounters. This stick and carrot system is a powerful enticement to keep playing, even after you’ve maxed out your level cap.<br />\r\nThe Home Turf DLC lets you purchase and customize your own home base. Lairs are pretty useful in that its personal mainframe gives you access to sidekicks, supply drops, and more while out in the field. Not to mention that you can also invade other people’s lairs or defend yours in fun group raids.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne thing that isn’t new is the setting. DC Universe Online came out right before DC Comics’ New 52 reboot of its comic book line, meaning that Tim Drake is still Robin and Superman still wears his classic red trunks. It’s disappointing that the DC Universe itself has changed, and the game can’t change along with it, but doing so would probably be a major overhaul. In comic book lingo, I prefer to think of it as taking place on one of DC’s unspecified parallel Earths.<br />\r\n',1386321072,'http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/12/02/dcuo021202131600jpg-8859c6.jpg','published','column_article',0),(99,'The Best Games For a Winter Holiday','The grey monotony of a British winter would drive anyone towards more gaming time, but I seek a particular kind of escapism in the winter months, like virtual tourism. Every December, as my bank balance creeps into the red before Christmas, I find myself gravitating towards virtual worlds soaked in sunlight, bright places where the skies and skies are blue and, ideally, there are beaches to visit. It’s like my personal, nerdier version of wistfully browsing Caribbean package holidays that you’ll never be able to afford on your lunch break.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe you’re not like me. Maybe you’re lucky enough to live somewhere that’s not miserable in the winter, somewhere that actually has proper snow and biting cold to enjoy rather than half-hearted British drizzle, or where it’s summer at Christmas. Maybe you can afford an actual holiday to a real place and you don’t spend the colder months curled up indoors, getting steadily paler and fatter until it’s remotely appealing to go outside again. If not, though, there are other ways to get your winter sun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFAR CRY 3<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of December 2012 was Far Cry 3 for me. I got rage-inducingly frustrated with a helicopter-related mission and abandoned it shortly before the story’s end after rinsing every optional  leopard-hunt, radio-tower and pirate encampment, but for the preceding 35 hours it was the ideal tropical escape, if you conveniently ignore all the heart-of-darkness, corruption-of-character, glorification-of-violence stuff. It’s got zip-lining, mountain-climbing, shark-hunting, STI-riddled pirates and drug-induced hallucinations, like any good tropical holiday. In seriousness, though, it’s the perfect winter game because its world is both gloriously bright, colourful and sunny and terrifyingly absorbing. I lost all of Boxing Day last year compulsively collecting ancient trinkets from submerged caves; a considerable improvement on the previous year, where I watched awful children’s television with my nephews until one of them threw up after eating too much chocolate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJUST CAUSE 2<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s old now, and looking rather aged next to some of the other open worlds on this list, but Just Cause 2 is another island escape that\'s more madcap than Far Cry 3, and with its god-awful plot and acting it also spiritually encapsulates another staple of Christmastime: terribly cheesy 80s action movies. Its genius is the grapple hook, which can be attached to pretty much anything, but most entertainingly to moving vehicles. It\'s also a compelling argument for including a parachute as a default inventory item in literally every game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSKYRIM<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, Skyrim’s world is wintry, but at least it’s properly wintry, unlike the half-hearted showers of wet snow that pass for “extreme weather” in my ludicrous country. And, crucially, there’s sun in Skyrim, gleaming off the pristine white mountains and frost-crisped landscapes. If Skyrim was a real place it would be an excellent ski resort, apart from the dragons. My personal favourite place to wander in Skyrim is up north in The Pale, west of Winterhold, where it’s dramatically snowy and the sun peeks through light blizzards and brightens up the surroundings. It stirs my Scottish blood to tramp through the snow in search of adventure (and also to fight for the independence of a small, proud Northern nation from the imperial rule of its Southern neighbours. Wonder why).

This happened to me far too often during my time with Tiny Brains, an indie puzzler for PlayStation 4. Its few really neat ideas are suffocated beneath finicky mechanics, uninspired and recycled challenges, a drab visual style, and long stretches of frustration. Even played in multiplayer as it’s obviously intended, Tiny Brains isn’t good – and it\'s even worse when you\'re playing alone.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe basic premise of Tiny Brains has a lot of potential: a group of four endearingly ugly critters who’ve been experimented on to the point of developing superpowers escapes their mad scientist captor. One can create blocks, a pair can Force push or pull objects, and the other one can swap places with anything in the environment. Each of the powers are great on paper, but stumble in execution.<br /><br />\r\nMost challenges revolve around going from point A to point B, with the occasional switch that needs to be pressed. Looking at a puzzle, I’d often quickly realize that I could solve it by, for example, creating a block with one character, pushing it across a chasm with another, and swapping places with it at the exact right moment with the third. Easy, right? The problem here is that the crappy tools and graphical hiccups seemed to actively work against me as I tried to execute that solution. Trying to highlight a specific object that you need to swap with on the other side of a room is tough thanks to the incredibly fussy aiming system. Using your push and pull abilities to roll a ball across a room filled with chasms becomes a chore when you can\'t quite get a handle on the ball\'s inertia. And then there\'s the power to create a block, which is underutilized in the level design to the point where the poor guy who got stuck playing as that character feels useless for long stretches of the multiplayer campaign.<br /><br />\r\nTiny Brains occasionally tosses an arena battle into the mix, but these quickly grow tiresome once you realize the quickest way to dispatch enemies and repeat it constantly for easy success. And aside from the main campaign, there are only a handful of challenge rooms where your team has to solve tough puzzles quickly, try to keep an object safe in a dangerous room, or play soccer against each other. These are completely forgettable diversions that serve little purpose beyond padding out the menu.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTiny Brains is even more infuriating when you attempt to solve its incredibly linear two-and-a-half-hour campaign by yourself. You have to hot-swap between the four creatures, and seeing as how most puzzles require at least three different abilities to solve, you’ll be doing a hell of a lot of swapping. Messing up while juggle characters only enhances that lingering frustration of trying to complete a puzzle after you\'ve already solved it in your head.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe best moments I had with Tiny Brains involved four people yelling at one another, gesturing toward areas of the television, and ultimately cheering in joy once we managed to physically solve a puzzle that we’d mentally conquered a few minutes back. These specific instances brought back fond memories of local multiplayer during the Nintendo 64-era – a time in gaming that  I\'d love to see more hearkened back to more often. Just... in a better game.<br /><br />\r\nBut while I have the luxury of working in an office full of PS4 controllers, I imagine many early adopters will have a tough time wrangling up the four controllers that are needed to experience Tiny Brains at its best. And though it does have an online mode, not being in the same room removes that chaotic fun, leaving you with just more frustration.',1386325157,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/04/tinybrains111213coverjpg-e96e72_948w.jpg','published','column_article',1),(101,'Most Anticipated Action Games of 2014','Next Gen is finally here!

Practically non-functioning menus? Check. Paper-thin gameplay mechanics? Check. Half-baked gesture controls that make simple, straightforward concepts feel vague and ungainly? Big check! The terribly written gobbledygook of a story merely adds insult to injury for a game that, top to bottom, feels like a flailing first attempt at using a new piece of hardware.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn theory, The Fighter Within is about going toe-to-toe with martial artists from a rival dojo. But your first, and most formidable opponent will be the Kinect-driven menus, which make even the basic act of scrolling through and selecting things an exercise in frustration. Confirming your choices requires that you hold a floaty, twitchy cursor over what you want, push in towards the screen, and then pull back, all without accidentally leaving the boundaries of what you\'re trying to press, because if you do, that resets the whole process. It\'s a borderline-broken system that left me with little choice but to keep a controller nearby at all times.<br />\r\nWhen you\'re finally ready to switch from fighting the interface to fighting other characters, things improve somewhat, if only briefly. The fundamentals of Fighter Within\'s system are sound enough, owing mostly to how well Kinect tracks basic movements like punches and kicks. Landing or blocking enough consecutive hooks and straights triggers a powerful combo or counter attack, complete with some snazzy animations and close ups. But unfortunately, they play out as in-engine cutscenes AFTER you\'ve thrown your blows. This separation of action and payoff means that when the best stuff is happening on screen, you\'re nothing but a spectator.<br />\r\nAnd that\'s when Fighter Within is working properly. The second it tries to do anything more elaborate, like throws or finishing moves, it trips over its own shoelaces and falls flat on its face. The gestures are simply too abstracted to feel anything like the moves they trigger, and worse yet, some are so similar to each other that you\'ll never be sure what\'s going to come out. I quickly lost count of how many times a throw attempt came out as a hook, or a straight kick got mixed up with a power attack. The result is a haphazard mess that both looks and feels disjointed. At one point, I lost 20 minutes of my life trying to perform the gesture to pick up a stick. Never again Kinect. Never again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf its borked controls weren\'t enough, Fighter Within plops a laughably bad story down on top of them. Meet Matt, a snot-nosed martial artist who wants to join a local dojo because...reasons. He and the rest of the cast generally take themselves very seriously, which means when you hear cheesy nonsense like this (play swag clip) you\'re more likely to laugh at them than with them. Some characters allude to personal motivations, and a lot of hot air gets blown around, but ultimately, it\'s nothing but a flimsy excuse to have you fight a long stream of AI opponents who look just as dumb as they fight. And every time things threaten to get even a little fun or spirited, someone starts moaning about mommy issues, or giving exposition about Genghis Khan. Not even making this stuff up, folks.',1386321756,'http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/11/22/fighterwithin111813coverjpg-8856a8_948w.jpg','published','column_article',0),(103,'DEVICE 6','I was lying in my bed, iPad in hand, surrounded on all sides by scraps of paper containing crudely scribbled notes. For the past hour, I\'d been stuck on a particularly tricky puzzle that appears early on in Device 6, a strange and wonderful interactive novel from Simogo, the Swedish developer behind Year Walk. I\'ve been guiding my character back and forth through this small chunk of an island, paying attention to every detail in the engaging prose and imagery, trying to pluck the one kernel of information I need in order to solve a combination lock at the end of the area. Suddenly, like a bolt of lightning that immediately precedes most revelations, the solution hit me: I rummaged through my notes and realized that I had solved the puzzle about half an hour ago, but didn\'t even know it.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy journey of solving this puzzle taught me some important things. First and foremost, I was completely in love with the story and presentation of Device 6. You begin your adventure as Anna, an amnesiac who wakes up on an island brimming with a \'60s Bond-esque aesthetics, atmospheric jazz score, and a heaping dose of J.J. Abrams-style mysteries. Unraveling the truth behind Anna, the island, and the strange puzzles that populate it provides some of the most mentally rewarding moments of any game I\'ve played this year.<br /><br />\r\nAll of this unfolds in text, still images, and occasional videos, but it’s done in a creative way that’s representative of the path Anna takes as she navigates the physical space of the island. Swiping across the story is analogous with guiding Anna across the mysterious expanse. When text scrolls to the right, Anna is heading east; when the words are presented in the form of downward steps, she\'s descending a staircase. When Anna encounters a mirror, the text is displayed backwards, forcing you to hold your iPhone or iPad up to an actual mirror. It’s a technique akin to the way Mark Z. Danielewski used typography to create a sense of unease in his novel House of Leaves, and it creates a sense of place and movement unlike any other text adventure I’ve ever played.<br /><br />\r\nThe prose itself is extremely well written, effortlessly hopping between humor and horror, all the while maintaining its central air of mystery. The specific images and videos that accompany the text add to the narrative while simultaneously serving as a source of clues needed to solve Device 6\'s various puzzles, which are devilishly tough, but always fair. Each of the six chapters reach a point where Anna hits some sort of obstacle, and it then becomes up to us to retrace our steps and take careful note of everything that we\'ve read, seen, and heard in order to pass. For instance, the end of one chapter had me jotting down notes as I listened to a series of cryptic espionage messages looping from the mouths of three stuffed bears, analyzing what each said in order to discover which one was telling the truth, and ultimately using that information to solve a combination lock which peeled back yet another layer of the fantastic story. The rewarding information became even more powerful because of what I had accomplished to earn it.<br /><br />\r\nNo matter how long a specific challenge may have taken me to solve, I never felt like I was being treated unfairly. Device 6 lays down its internal logic and core set of rules right from the starts, and it\'s then up to us to pay attention to its context clues, which are hidden (sometimes in plain sight) within text, imagery, sounds, and geography. Few puzzle games have ever married these types of clues in such a fantastic union. But if you do happen to get stuck, check out our incredible Wiki for tips on how to solve a particular predicament.<br /><br />\r\nMy playthrough ran over the course of six nights, tackling a single chapter in each session. These ranged from a breezy 15-minute run where a puzzle clicked immediately, to the nearly two-hour odyssey of scribbled notes, crudely drawn maps, and an ultimate sense of great satisfaction. Throughout my five hours or so with Device 6, I had to uncover lock combinations, decode Cold War-era messages, and pay attention to each and every adjective in the story in order to make my way through its devilishly challenging puzzles. Perhaps best of all, the end of Device 6\'s journey culminates with one of the most satisfying payoffs I\'ve ever experienced in a video game. Seriously, the final chapter really ties the room together.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nDevice 6 is fantastic regardless of which iOS device you decide to play it on, despite the experiences being slightly different. An iPhone\'s smaller size makes the necessity of constantly twisting and turning your physical device a breeze, where the larger real estate of an iPad makes the gorgeous, Wes Anderson-style typography pop even more. And though the solutions to the puzzles remain static on a second playthrough and lose those fantastic \"aha!\" moments, I gladly took another trip through Device 6 for the same reason I annually replay Portal. Going back through those worlds allow me to gain newfound insight into the story and characters in the same way that rereading a favorite book sheds a new light on it.',1386325425,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/11/27/device6110113coverjpg-e96c89_948w.jpg','published','column_article',0),(104,'THE WOLF AMONG US EPISODE 1: FAITH','Stepping out from the monumental shadow of Telltale\'s superb take on The Walking Dead, the first episode of the five-part The Wolf Among Us series immediately stakes its own claim as one of the most exciting adventure games of the year. Titled Faith, this episode makes filling the shoes of Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of a magical version of New York City populated by the fairytale characters that we all grew up with, is an energetic and memorable experience. Telltale builds upon the same emphasis of choice and consequence as its 2012 predecessor, while providing a starkly different tone via just how physical it is for an adventure game.<br /><br />\r\nThroughout this two-hour chunk of adventure, I enjoyed making many tough decisions as the imposing sheriff of this strange, dangerous, and magical world. I had no qualms with roughing up a suspect, busting down doors, or tearing apart a room during a fight. That last one is particularly important, because the action scenes in Faith are absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThink of them as choreographing a fight scene in a movie through the lens of a choose-your-own-adventure book. During a scuffle, the action periodically pauses for a brief moment and gives you the choice of how to proceed. Do you try to talk your way out of a fight, or surprise them with a sucker punch? Toss your opponent at a dresser, or smash them into a sink? Use a bottle, or keep swinging your fists? The handful of these scenes provided a nice bit of excellent chaos, and I felt the urge to replay each one in order to see what sort of different outcomes I could reach if I’d chosen differently. These work particularly well on an iOS device, as the act of tapping on a object to grab it or swiping across the screen to swing a fist feels incredibly satisfying.<br /><br />\r\nThis physicality isn’t just limited to our actions as Bigby – the entire world is populated by brash, violent, and downright entertaining characters. As a prequel story to Bill Willingham’s Fables comic series, the story revolves around solving a shocking murder while trying to maintain a semblance of order among a tight-knit community of displaced fairytale characters. Every moment of this episode\'s investigation is filled intriguing characters, mysterious settings, and fantastic writing.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nDuring your search, you\'ll come across cockney toads who refuse to hide themselves from the human world, a member of the Three Little Pigs with a bit of a drinking problem, and an abusive woodsman with a startling revelation regarding Snow White. Since it’s based on characters that pretty much everybody knows, The Wolf Among Us is able to toy with us by upending expectations and delivering some truly surprising and entertaining character beats. It\'s amazing how the dialogue drifts between funny, tragic, brutal, and magical all over a course of the two-hour episode.<br /><br />\r\nEven the presentation of Faith pops in a way that successfully highlights the harsh oddities of this strange world. All of this episode’s great interactions are delivered with a neon color palette and a stylish synthesized score that brings to mind shades of Drive and John Carpenter\'s movies, all of which work towards building the mood of a late-\'80s noir. As you make your way across the gritty boroughs of this alternate New York City, you’ll experience a great juxtaposition between the grime of the city and the wonderment of magic.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSadly, the first leg of this journey is marred by a noticeably choppy framerate, one of the main problems of The Walking Dead. Transitions often stutter for a brief moment, and each time it removed me from that world for a fraction of a second. These hiccups are more noticeable on the console and mobile versions of the game than the PC one. It\'s not a deal-breaker, but it’s an annoyance I’m disappointed to see reoccur in this new series. Of course, it doesn’t stop me from enjoying the impeccable story and my sense of ownership over it any more than it did in The Walking Dead.<br /><br />\r\nBigby\'s arc is punctuated by big moments of obvious decision-making where the gameplay will slow to a halt and let you linger on which path you want to go down. Despite being a bit on the nose with announcing those moments, knowing exactly where a big intersection was made me want to immediately go back and replay the episode to see what would\'ve happened had I made different decisions. A character who died in one playthrough can survive another. A suspect in custody at the end of my run may still be on the loose in yours. Unlike many adventure games, where I view my single playthrough as my own personal gospel, I see myself going back to uncover every corner of Bigby\'s complicated web.',1386322027,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/10/wolf-610x342.jpg','published','column_article',0),(105,'KILLZONE: SHADOW FALL','If 2011 was the year Killzone found itself on the ropes, then 2013 is the year the franchise regains its footing. Killzone 3, released a couple of years ago on PlayStation 3, was considered by many to be a low point for the series, but earlier this year, Killzone: Mercenary on PS Vita set it back on the right course, and the PlayStation 4 launch game, Killzone: Shadow Fall, shows us an entirely new side of the franchise.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nShadow Fall goes a lot further than Mercenary in attempting to remedy some of what was wrong with the franchise, and developer Guerrilla Games has smartly (and obviously) studied its contemporaries in the shooter space for inspiration on how make its series excel again. The Dutch studio has created a Killzone game that feels, in some respects, like a reimagining of what its been endlessly working on since the PlayStation 2 era. It takes slivers of Halo, Call of Duty, Crysis, and Deus Ex to deliver something staggeringly different for Killzone, something longtime fans in particular may not expect.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nKillzone has always been a bleak-looking game, a product of its equally bleak story surrounding two factions of warring humans, the Vektans and the Helghast, but Shadow Fall one makes a welcome turn for the colorful. It takes place decades after the catastrophic events at the end of Killzone 3, with the conflict between the two sides turning into a bona fide cold war as a result of once again living on the same planet. This story has allowed Guerrilla to explore different, more subtle themes, in turn letting the team flex its artistic muscles in ways it never had a chance to.<br /><br />\r\nThis becomes immediately evident as soon as you begin the single-player campaign. The wake of endless war -- and the invasive industrial feel of previous entries -- have stepped aside for stunning, colorful cityscapes, lush forests, and abandoned space stations. Shadow Fall’s environments are gorgeous, diverse, and have a tangible feeling of scope, and it’s the pristineness of many of them that make them special. It’s easy to lose track of time staring off into Vekta City’s impressive skyline, or run around looking at the plant life in the forest alongside the wall that keeps the two sides away from one another. And while it doesn’t always run at or near 60 frames per second, Shadow Fall performs nicely, with motion blur slyly hiding some of its rough technical edges.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlso eliminated is one of the most well-known and divisive components of the franchise: its incredibly heavy-feeling movement. Mercifully, that mystifying sluggishness is long gone, making Shadow Fall faster and snappier than Killzone has ever been, making way for a shooter that feels, at its core, a lot more like Halo than Killzone 3. And though enemy AI is occasionally lacking, as Helghan foes at times don’t practice self-preservation or seem to even “turn on,” it’s normally up to par, and firing your weapons into them is a blast. So much so that I have to wonder why Guerrilla thought taking so long to put a gun into your hand and let you out of your tutorial-laden cage was a good idea.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOnce you’re out of that cage, you’ll get to explore a story that, like its aesthetic and feel, is also starkly different than what came before it. Unchained from the more conventional war between the Helghast and Vektans, Guerrilla has decided to explore a plot that’s full of cold war nuance. The uneasy peace between the two sides, split by a literal wall, evokes a heavy post-war Germany influence (much like the Helghast throughout the series rely heavily on a fascist, Nazi-like imagery).<br /><br />\r\nThis means that big, open battlefields and endless arrays of gunfights are replaced with around 10 hours of more thoughtful, quieter missions that are interspersed with the setpiece battles I know, love, and expect. There’s even an attempt at stealth, though it doesn’t always work very well. You can sneak up behind enemies or fall on top of them unawares for a variety of violent knife kills, but these aren’t always executed as you intend, and it’s fairly common for what should have been an amazing flourish with your blade to turn into a decidedly unsubtle rifle-butt attack, inevitably alerting every other enemy in the area to your presence.<br /><br />\r\nThe story itself is a bit muddled -- and even nonsensical at times -- but it’s the varied environments it allows you to explore that makes it palatable, if not outright enjoyable. As you jump between the Vektan and Helghan sides of the wall (and elsewhere), you’ll find yourself in all sorts of interesting places that a straightforward war scenario, like those found in previous Killzone games, wouldn’t allow for. It’s unlikely Killzone 2 or 3 would have had you running through a three-story townhouse rescuing hostages in the middle of a city totally unaware that anything bad was happening. But in Shadow Fall, that’s just another day at the office for your character, mysterious Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellen, someone capable of both killing and feeling, a twist for a Killzone protagonist.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are interesting characters to meet (some better voice-acted than others), civilians to interact with, and a ton of story-driving collectibles to find. But the various degrees of non-linearity in each mission really is the hallmark of the single-player campaign. It, along with Shadow Fall’s new graphical flair, is what sets it apart from other Killzone games more than anything else, and represents a new chapter for the franchise.<br /><br />\r\nI absolutely adored how it often challenged me to go about things in different and unique ways, especially on certain maps where you can go in any direction you please. Early in the campaign, you find yourself on the Helghan side of the wall in a stunningly beautiful forest searching for the crew of a downed Vektan aircraft, but before you do, you can stray to the far side of the woods to take out the security station. If you’re seen, you could use your special robotic friend, OWL, to shut off alarms and stop reinforcements from coming, or you could simply shoot everybody in your way. There’s not only inherent strategy to be employed here; there’s inherent replayability, too.<br /><br />\r\nThe aforementioned OWL – your airborne robotic companion – is the final trump card in Killzone’s repertoire. It can be dispatched to stun or outright attack enemies, it can deploy a shield to give ample protection from enemy fire, and it can even shoot out a zipline that allows access to platforms and other far away areas, giving Shadow Fall an unexpected – albeit underused – feeling of verticality.',1386325276,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/kz3-610x343.jpg','published','review_article',1),(106,'RESOGUN','Up, down, left, right. Before playing Resogun, those four words correspond to distinct directions. After a few rounds of Housemarque’s latest and most impressive twin-stick shoot ‘em up, those bearings blurred and gave way to one simple mantra: move or die. In its short but highly replayable campaign, Resogun creates an energetic, beautiful, and addictive loop of score chasing that’s tough to break free from.<br /><br />\r\nMany shooters are fought on a flat plane, but Resogun takes that plane and wraps space onto itself, creating a cylindrical battlefield. This choice sounds strange on paper, as it literally sends you around in circles, but the result is novel and refreshing gameplay. Enemies on the other side of the map can be seen before they’re encountered, letting you better judge the opposition and ration your limited weapons. Your standard laser rounds follow the curvature of the map, but only for a short distance. This allows for some tricky maneuvering, like trying to pick off enemies from outside of their most effective ranges. Mindless blasting is, thankfully, neither encouraged nor welcomed here.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIt’s immediately noticeable that your ship can’t fire up or down – only horizontally. What initially seems like an arbitrary decision soon becomes a clear message: pay more attention to your positioning. Overcoming your limited attack angles means doubling down on movement skills, which prepares you for Resogun’s trickiest stages. It’s a teaching technique that feels more useful and more fun than any tutorial or loading screen hint.<br /><br />\r\nThe arsenal is nothing out of the ordinary for a side-scrolling shooter. You can shoot, boost, launch bombs, and unleash a devastating overdrive beam that slows and decimates nearby enemies. The kicker is, aside from your standard lasers, everything is limited in some way. You start a level with only a few bombs, for example, and your powerful overdrive attack is charged only after collecting parts from defeated enemies. Resogun also rewards you with points for not activating any bombs during a round, so using one feels like both a victory and a loss. These restrictions lead to wonderfully tense moments where you’ll fight within an inch of your life before unleashing a super weapon because you don’t want to be penalized. The power Resogun offers is not without consequence, and I enjoyed that ever-present tension.<br /><br />\r\nMany of the stages look similar, but at least they all look great. When the screen is packed with enemies, glowing and twirling and spewing lasers and fireballs, it’s hard not to be impressed. The music, equally energetic and upbeat, is an excellent soundtrack for cosmic destruction. In a game like Resogun where gameplay is king, it’s imperative the frame rate never dips, and despite the veritable fireworks display, it stayed smooth.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nResogun promotes aggression through score multipliers that reset if you don’t score kills frequently enough, though not the reckless sort. You’ll have to play skillfully and without a moment of downtime. This need for speed couples well with Resogun’s boost feature, which lets you travel through enemies, and triggers an area-of-effect attack when you drop back to normal speed. Timing your boosts to escape danger or destroy a massive cluster of enemies requires foresight and restraint, and pulling it off always feels great. When a game’s goals directly inform its mechanics as Resogun’s do, that’s a sign of terrific game design.<br /><br />\r\nOn top of that, at the beginning of each level you’re given one optional instruction: “Save the last humans.” Rescuing tiny people from their scattered cube prisons isn’t just a fun side distraction to keep you busy; it, like many other parts of Resogun, reinforces the idea that you need to keep moving at all times. It also earns you some extra points, lives, or bombs for your trouble.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThough Resogun’s expectations for you are rigid, it offers a choice of three spacecraft with which to face its challenges. The selection is a standard but comprehensive lineup: one is fast and weak, one is slow and powerful, and one is balanced. Not having to unlock them was a smart move on the designers’ part.<br /><br />\r\nThe five stages end in boss battles, but not all of them put up a real fight. For example, you must venture inside of one of the bosses, shooting it while avoiding moving beams and walls. Another fires lasers out of each hole you blast into it, making the fight more difficult as you progress. Others can be defeated simply by fleeing and firing behind you while occasionally boosting. After fighting to the bone to reach a supposedly difficult enemy, it’s a shame to sometimes be let off the hook so easily.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSpeaking of high scores, if you don’t find them to be a sufficient carrot at the end of the stick, Resogun’s short play time may leave you wanting more. It takes around an hour to beat the missions on normal difficulty, but it should absolutely be replayed for high scores. Higher difficulties put a welcome pressure on, and had my palms sweating the sweat of a challenge well-met. Because missions are quick, and because there’s a nice variety of tough enemies and maneuvers available, Resogun encourages you to keep coming back to nab the high score and dethrone your friends.<br /><br />\r\nIf you’re not the competitive type, the online-only co-op mode is a great way to enjoy Resogun with a friend. There are no specific two-player moves or other actual co-op mechanics, but it’s still fun coordinating to cover more ground and save humans on opposite sides of the arena. Bosses receive a noticeable vitality boost in this mode, so you don’t feel too overpowered as a duo. Unfortunately, there’s no way to earn more lives, so if you’re playing with someone who’s more skilled than you, prepare to spend a lot of time waiting for the next round. Or, you know, get better at Resogun.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTHE VERDICT<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith some deceptively simple changes, Housemarque took a genre nearly as old as videogaming itself and made a tense, challenging, and excellent shooter. It may be short, but its addictive cycle of cylindrical shooter gameplay, great looks, and catchy music make it worth replaying in endless pursuit of that high score on the leaderboard.',1386325442,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/swarm-610x343.jpg','published','review_article',0),(107,'KNACK','SMALL THINGS COME IN BIG PACKAGES.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLike Skylanders or Traveler\'s Tales LEGO games, Knack is a fairly straight-ahead brawler with a visual charm that will appeal to younger gamers. As you dig into its design, you\'ll initially be wowed by the prospect of Knack\'s promise of changing the main character\'s scale. Moving from tiny Knack to big Knack as you progress through the levels adds a wonderful sense of scale. Unfortunately, none of Knack\'s strengths are enough to overcome its confused tone and an overly restrictive design that ensures you\'re never anywhere the designers don\'t want you to be.<br /><br />\r\nThe best and most interesting part of Knack is the character\'s ability to grow as he accumulates additional relics. As Knack takes damage, he loses relics, which makes him smaller and more vulnerable. He can reclaim those relics, and increase in size, mostly by busting open crates scattered throughout the levels. The bigger Knack can not only take more damage, but also has stronger attacks and has a much longer reach.  Some of the more extreme changes in scale also give you a tremendous sense of perspective in power. Walking over, sometimes literally, the tiniest enemies as a giant version of Knack is one of it\'s finest moments.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat transition where you suddenly find yourself able to wade through any and all opposition is one of Knack\'s best and most reliable payoffs, but even that\'s sometimes spoiled by enemies that can kill you in one-shot and tedious end bosses. The standard for success shifts from doing things intelligently and creatively in the early parts, to doing things perfectly and predictably towards the end.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI love the concept of managing your speed, size, and strength as actual resources and there\'s loads of potential for intriguing dilemmas where you need to risk those assets to acquire even more. Unfortunately, whether you\'re big or small in this game is more dependent on what the designer wants than on your own choices and actions. While small variations in size are generally tolerated, nearly every level decides just how big or small you\'re going to be. Whether you\'re trading in all your extra relics to open a door at the end of an early level, or opening up a giant box of relics just prior to a late-game boss fight, developer SCE Japan seems scared to let us be in control of too much.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis disappointment also applies to some of the alternate materials Knack can absorb. It\'s great to build a Knack out of mirrors, or ice, or flaming logs, but those elements are only ever available in specific situations where they\'re the only answer to the problem in front of you. As you play, you\'ll unlock special alternate versions of Knack, such as a vampire Knack who has to defeat enemies to offset a steady and persistent decline in relics. It technically adds a bit to the replayability to try levels as an alternate version of Knack, but not enough to keep bringing us back after that initial playthrough.<br /><br />\r\nMost of your time in Knack will be spent fighting and the range of enemies is generally satisfying, with each specific enemy type requiring a slightly different approach. Some jump and land with massive area attacks, others shoot waves of fast-moving projectiles, and still others are protected behind giant energy fields. The combination of enemies, particularly when one is a ranged fighter and the other likes to get close in, can also make for some tense tactical fights. Outside of a few special moves, there\'s really only one attack button, but it\'s varied based on how big you are, who you\'re fighting, and how close you are to them.  You can attack while jumping to create a sort of invincible TMNT-style attack that will keep you alive through many a trouble.<br /><br />\r\nSony calls Knack a platformer, but there\'s really very little exploration or environmental challenges. Sure, there are some jumping sequences and traps, and the ever-present secret rooms, but the succession of fighting areas are small with one obvious entrance and one obvious exit, and it\'s just lather, rinse, repeat as you move from enemy to enemy. You\'ll occasionally be allowed to use other materials to build Knack – mirrors for instance can help get past security systems – but their use is always obvious and mandatory, so the player isn\'t really involved at all. What makes this particularly confusing is when the weak and puny humans take alternate routes to the end of the level without any clear story reason why you didn\'t just go along with them and avoid all the trouble in the meantime.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are other choices that disengage the player. There are loads of short transition cutscenes where Knack jumps off a ledge, or climbs over a low wall, which is all stuff the player is usually doing anyway, so it\'s jarring to have the game wrest control away just to show you doing something you\'ve already done a dozen times already. Worse are the cutscenes that show Knack doing something spectacularly cool, like destroying a munitions plant, that feel like they\'re cheating the player out of the payoff for an entire level.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nKnack also struggles with some story issues, both with regard to the plot and the overall tone. There\'s only one character with any comprehensible goal or discernible backstory, and he\'s neither the hero nor the villain, which makes it hard to engage with the content. We might be willing to give games of this genre a pass on the thin narrative, but Knack continually seems to want to tell a story that just keeps falling apart. You start off fighting the goblins, who were kicked out of the cities by the humans, but it\'s never really established that the humans deserve to be spared from the goblins\' revenge. You just beat the crap out of them because that\'s what the plot demands. Knack is full of these sorts of assumptions.<br /><br />\r\nI\'m not quite sure what to make of Knack\'s tone, which is just as ambiguous as the story. The little version of Knack is undeniably adorable, in spite of his always-serious Ron Perlman voice, and the big 50-foot tall version is absolutely intimidating with a strong sense of power, even though it looks distractingly like a Muppet. While the character designs are intriguing, it\'s hard for me to look at Knack\'s face and not wonder at the lack of humor or charm in the rest of the game. The whole story reminds me of the relics that make up Knack himself – some basic, recognizable forms that really don\'t serve any function beyond giving Knack his shape.<br /><br />\r\nBECOME A FAN OF IGN<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTrending Content<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nGran Turismo 6 Review<br /><br />\r\n2,092 reading now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSony Warns of \'Irregular Activity\' on PSN Accounts<br /><br />\r\n712 reading now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBay: \"I Do Not Apologize\" For Transformers<br /><br />\r\n288 reading now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 - First Trailer - IGN Rewind Theater<br /><br />\r\n287 watching now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMan Pays $750 / £450 for Xbox One Photo in eBay Scam<br /><br />\r\n260 reading now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFallout 4: Bethesda Isn\'t Making Announcements Soon<br /><br />\r\n197 reading now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nX-Men: Apocalypse in 2016<br /><br />\r\n159 reading now<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNintendo\'s 9 Different Holiday Hardware Bundles<br /><br />\r\n146 reading now<br /><br />\r\nTHE VERDICT<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nPlaying Knack is like watching a dull movie on a plane – it\'s tolerable if all you want is a way to pass the time, but it\'s not something you\'d seek out for its own sake. I finished in about 11 hours and, challenges, co-op, and secrets aside, there\'s just not much here worth recommending. Sure, some individual elements show potential, particularly when the scale of the encounters changes as Knack grows, but it never moves beyond playing it safe with the concepts or the characters.',1386325291,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/05/knack624jpg-e96eaf.jpg','published','review_article',1),(108,'THE RAVEN: LEGACY OF A MASTER THIEF, CHAPTER 3 - A MURDER OF RAVENS','Having started well in episode one and continued poorly in episode two, The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief has much to prove as it wraps things up in its third and final chapter. Despite the pressure to redeem itself and finish strong, this flawed finale stumbles hard due to odd story choices and frequent technical issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the main issues with episode two, Ancestry of Lies, was that it pulled the rug out from under me by changing heroes mid-stream. Abandon all hope, ye who wish to return to the likable Swiss constable, Jakob Anton Zellner; it\'s just not happening. Instead, you\'re forced to continue on with two alternate heroes, neither of whom are particularly appealing. You\'re also forced, once again, to go back in time and review incidents that have already happened (albeit from different characters\' perspectives). This flashback strategy can be compelling when handled properly, but here it falls flat. The two playable characters aren\'t strictly a part of the investigation, and that makes it hard to care much about what they do. On top of that, since the chapter more or less revisits everything you\'ve done in the first half of the game, there\'s nothing new to see.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is one benefit to reliving events—gaining additional information about the suspects. Profound shifts in sympathy occur in A Murder of Ravens as conversations reveal the motives behind the guiltier characters\' actions, and the more innocent-seeming characters show what they\'re truly capable of. This is the chapter\'s main strength since it throws serious doubt upon any conclusions you might have thus far drawn. Plot twists also abound, repeatedly forcing you to rethink your guesses regarding the identity of the Raven. This is fortunate since it helps divert attention from the many technical problems plaguing A Murder of Ravens.<br />\r\nKing Art makes real effort to differentiate its characters, and it\'s nice to see how each character has not only a distinct look, but distinct movement. Sadly, these expressive animations are undermined by pathfinding issues that have characters running into things, walking in place, and mechanically changing direction like robots on turntables. This problem appeared in the previous two chapters but was never as apparent as it is here, and as a result, navigation can be an issue when moving in close quarters. Several areas of the ship environment are downright obstructive when trying to re-situate the hero and view additional exits.<br />\r\nAdditionally, strange animation and placement bugs frequently occur, making objects move strangely and characters pop suddenly from place to place. One of the heroes suffers horribly from Botox face and looks with his utterly immobile facial muscles, as if he\'s been seriously sedated. Lucky for him, a capable voice actor manages to give him some measure of vitality. Actually, A Murder of Ravens owes most of its vibrancy to its vocal performances, which effectively manipulate our feelings regarding the suspects, as does the tremendous musical score.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of puzzles, A Murder of Ravens demands more careful observance of each scene than the previous two episodes and as such, can force you to spend more adventure points than you otherwise might. (Adventure points allow you to reveal all the interactive areas in the scene.) Even with adventure point-purchased help, some puzzles rely on regrettable contrivances that make clear what you\'re meant to do, but then don\'t allow you to do it or fail to provide the feedback (a certain entry list puzzle comes to mind) you need to understand why you can\'t progress.<br />\r\nThese obstacles to fun are significant, but if you can withstand them you\'re in for a fairly exciting climax and an ending that\'s likely to outwit all but the most astute mystery buffs. You\'ll also experience a well-written epilogue that effectively ties up most of the loose ends (some characters vanish from the story inexplicably) and a post-epilogue sequence that could be a set-up for a future mystery.

Redshirt isn\'t actually a Star Trek game; it\'s far too irreverent, and pokes fun outside of Trek lore, like the matriarchal “Asrion” race (a dig at Mass Effect\'s Asari). It’s full of sly, loving nods at the unacknowledged roles that are never shown on screen, like the poor guy who has to clean up after a transporter accident. But what makes Redshirt special is its brutal, extraordinarily effective satire of modern human interaction. Unfortunately, despite having a central focus, Redshirt struggles at being a complete game beyond its satire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe core of Redshirt is a social simulation. Like in The Sims, you create a character just assigned to the space station Megalodon-9 and guide them through friendship, romance, and their career. This is done primarily through Spacebook, a Facebook knockoff where Redshirt’s truly vicious satire kicks in. Because it reduces human behavior into only what’s documented online, Redshirt forces you to treat relationships and hobbies as manipulable, disposable, and only useful as far as they can improve your character\'s position.<br />\r\nFor example: every character has three interests, like Fitness, Games, Music, Culture, Self-Indulgence etc. For everyone else on the station, those interests are set in stone. For your character, they can be changed by items you buy or events you schedule on Spacebook. So if you go out to eat regularly, eventually you\'ll have “Xenogastronomy” become one of your interests. There’s a strong gameplay mechanic here of figuring out which interests will be the most successful at achieving your goals, then figuring out the most efficient way to build that while maintaining friendships. And you need to change your interests around to progress – other characters won\'t friend you if they don\'t share an interest, and higher-level jobs require that you possess those interests in order to get. Unless, of course, you start sleeping with the hiring manager – which again, requires manipulating their interests until they like you. I liked the way the game considered identity as something fluid, and playing it with any sense of ambition forced me to wonder how my own presentation of my online social life was less about who I am and more about what’s useful to me in the moment, which is quite clever.<br />\r\nYou could, alternately, get your redshirt a steady job and some friends and try to live a decent, happy life. But the problems with that approach start to show where Redshirt falls apart. First, there\'s no strong external pressure that forces difficult decisions. Everything in Redshirt revolves around your character, with the exception of an unnamed event that will supposedly destroy the station 160 days after your character\'s arrival. Because the destruction event isn\'t specified and no story works toward it, all it gives is a motivation to earn as much money or power as is required to avoid it. Everyone else on the station behaves as if all is normal, all the time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDay-to-day interactions suffer from a lack pressure or urgency. As you make friends, you won\'t be able to keep everyone happy – there will be break-ups, rejections, lonely obsessions, and so on. But the enemies you make don\'t compete against you for jobs, or try to turn your other friends against you – just a stream of nasty messages. They, and almost everything else on Megalodon-9, are static. The one partial exception to this rule is the occasional Away Mission you\'re called to do. There, you and teams of other random grunts are threatened and a few are killed, occasionally leading to you having to make a decision of who to leave behind.<br />\r\nSecond, the act of day-to-day play isn\'t terribly entertaining. The positive feedback loop of setting goals and then attaining them works, but there\'s nothing else. This is a common issue with social simulations: their focus on slowly changing, abstract relationships doesn\'t provide direct challenges; it\'s too two-dimensional. A game like The Sims gets around this through use of space; success allows you to expand and improve your living arrangements. Or a game like Crusader Kings II has both internal and familial politics to deal with at a two-dimension level, but it also has the external politics of trying to improve your nation\'s positions on the map. Redshirt has no spatial component whatsoever. This means that if you ever get stuck in a rut – say, needing to just put your head down and work a job for another week to level up a skill – it provides no intrinsic rewards just for the act of playing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, Redshirt is a little bit glitchy. Most of the glitches are cosmetic, like the wrong text or window being overlaid on something it shouldn\'t, and can easily be worked around. But I did have one bug where suddenly my characters\' interests went totally haywire, and she was into Music far beyond every other skill, without even trying, which seriously hampered my ability to change my character\'s personality in order to get promotions. The developer is quite responsive and consistently patches the game, though, so it has more of a “occasionally ragged indie” feeling than a “this game isn\'t ready.”',1386322924,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/12/247870_screenshots_2013-11-27_00001-610x343.jpg','published','basic_article',0),(110,'X REBIRTH','There are two major sets of problems with Egosoft\'s X Rebirth. First, it’s cursed with a tremendous number of technical issues, making it unstable and glitchy while hamstringing its performance, even on my mid-range gaming PC. Those failings may change with time and patches, but the second and more significant set of problems will not: from conception to execution, X Rebirth consistently misses the mark about what is valuable and interesting in an open-ended space sim. It’s consumed by minutiae and a terrible interface for managing it, turning what could have been a lightspeed journey among the stars into something more akin to a numbing, monotonous trudge across a crowded mall parking lot on a hot summer day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX Rebirth is unconscionably padded out with time-wasting quest lines that involve almost nothing but travel from one boring, ugly space station to another. Pick any mission, and the odds are good that you\'ll have to spend 10 minutes traveling along the \"space highways\" — more on this in a second — and then another five minutes flying around at regular speed, staring at different parts of a station like some kind of wall-eyed aquarium fish trying to find specks of food.<br />\r\nThat feeling of being in an aquarium is not helped by the fact that everything seems awash in neon nebular space gas. Space, as presented in X Rebirth, is not black and empty but is incredibly busy with gas trails, shiny asteroids, and ginormous space stations with billboards on them. It\'s striking at first, but eventually wearying. If everything looks big, bright and spectacular...then eventually, nothing does.<br />\r\nGetting close to things and staring at them is a major part of X Rebirth. It\'s how you find missions, commercial transactions, landing bays, and even hackable objects. This is because X Rebirth doesn\'t believe in menus, opting instead for hyper-immersion. Why open a menu and select the option you want when you can spend five minutes flying around an enormous space refinery looking for that escort mission you glimpsed fleetingly a few minutes earlier? Why design a sensible and intuitive trade interface when you can fly within 10 feet of a briefcase icon and place a larger order for energy cells? And in between space stations, you can ride the space highways where you go faster by tail-gating other ships, so you can spend your trip among the stars staring at someone\'s space-bumper.<br />\r\nWhen you finally reach your destination, you can dock and go explore the ship or space station in first-person perspective, which sounds more exciting than it actually is. There\'s only a handful of stock station layouts, so wherever you go in the galaxy, it feels like you\'re right back where you started, talking to the same slack-faced drones. There\'s a even a bizarre layout where you can go buy weapons and goods from vendors who are plainly inside what is supposed to be a prison.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX Rebirth just offers the wrong kind of immersion. It\'s all the petty chores and frustrations of everyday with none of the excitement promised by the sci-fi setting. Doing anything in X Rebirth is like spending twenty minutes looking for your car keys and wallet before getting stuck in gridlock on your way to a store that probably doesn\'t even have what you want.<br />\r\nIf it sounds like I\'m focusing on nitpicks rather than “the real game\" — the one with all the trading and ship-ownership and the story of a galaxy on the brink of war — it\'s because this is the real game. This stuff, the endless wandering, the lousy menus, the dumb first-person sequences, has taken up four fifths of my time with X Rebirth, while the \"good stuff\" never actually arrives. Admittedly, it\'s been slow going due to the one-crash-per-hour instability it averaged before the last two updates, but the bottom line is that X Rebirth wastes your time far more effectively than it delivers any kind of rewards.<br />\r\nEven when combat does break out, it\'s about on par with the original Wing Commander series, which was great in its day, but just doesn’t cut it now. Your ship is painfully slow, so a lot of fights come down to watching your enemy fly away, turn around, and then come back for a head-on firing pass. The trick is having better gun and shield upgrades so that you can survive these \"shoot each other in the face\" contests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere\'s a story, but it\'s really not worth playing for. You play an everyman, Ren Otani, who stumbles across a super-ship from the last war and gets it up and running. Then he meets Yisha, a terribly voice-acted copilot who gets him involved in a resistance movement against an evil mining corporation and… look, you fly around space looking at things and talking to people, okay? There\'s a quest chain that basically culminates with you editing the mining corporation’s WIkipedia page. It\'s a dragged-out tutorial with awful voice acting.<br />\r\nBut really, what damns Rebirth is that its interface is designed around poorly conceived gamepad controls that constrain every other control option. While you can use mouse and keyboard, you’re still forced to navigate through layer upon layer of simplified menus. And where  a few efficient keyboard shortcuts could have taken care of communications, navigation, and targeting, instead we get a weird contextual HUD that never actually tells me what I want to know, an unusable map interface, and an absurdly deep chains of radial menus. To top it all off, X Rebirth failed to recognize my Saitek x52 flight stick and throttle, interpreting it instead as a 360 pad and ignoring most of the buttons. I know that joysticks aren\'t as common as they were during the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter era, but it’s still an option a lot of space sim fans want.',1386323007,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/12/x-rebirth-enginebay03jpg-e93a5b_640w-610x359.jpg','published','basic_article',0),(111,'CHIVALRY: DEADLIEST WARRIOR','Exploding heads, blood spray, and gurgling death rattles punctuate the delightful multi-player mayhem of Chivalry: Deadliest Warrior. This DLC follow-up to last year\'s first-person brawler,  Medieval Warfare, doesn\'t disappoint in its sheer brutality, but it’s the awesome new factions that let you run screaming into the fray as pirates, ninjas, and other fierce combatants that really heighten the fun this time around.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRather than offer more of the same knight-on-knight combat, Deadliest Warrior\'s action unfolds between six distinct groups – Samurai, Pirates, Vikings, Ninjas, Spartans, and Knights. The variety this brings to the battlefield, both in terms of different appearances and fighting styles, is a welcome change from the four similar Knight classes of its predecessor. Every faction serves as its own class, and leveling each warrior type gradually opens up a diverse armory of cool, culture-specific weaponry to draw from. Amassing experience with each kill or assist provides great forward momentum, keeping me hooked for match-after-match of wanton slaughter.<br />\r\nSticking with a single warrior until you\'ve maxed out their arsenal is satisfying, but the subtle nuances of the different factions’ fighting styles make each one a blast to play. Vikings, for example, are speedy, can dual-wield, and are able to hurl their weaponry -- including shields -- to gain a surprise advantage, even if it means they\'re left with nothing but their fists to fight with. Heavily armored Spartans, on the other hand, always start with a shield and a long spear. They can either stab with the latter or hurl it permanently, automatically forcing a switch to a sword for closer combat. Other warriors have similarly interesting quirks to set them apart, and the groups are well balanced in terms of both their capabilities and gear selection.<br />\r\nVaried loadout combinations within each faction are also a big draw here – as are the unique goodies each one lets you fight with. Shuriken, bladed claws, flaming rum bottles, pistols, and many other dangerous playthings greatly expand the range of strategic options in combat. Which role you fill on the battlefield is now a lot more fluid too, thanks to the excellent option to cherrypick your primary and secondary weapons from just about anything you\'ve unlocked for your warrior. That means I can double down on melee gear or swap one out for a missile weapon, and I love the differences in each weapon’s reach, damage, and speed. They have a very tangible impact on fighting tactics when I\'m face-to-face with a mob of dudes trying to gut me.<br />\r\nDeadliest Warrior\'s magic isn\'t all in its weapons, though. The combat itself is still just as nutty and hyper-violent as ever, which is part of what drew me in to the original. Matches are fast-paced and intense, particularly when they play out in bigger arenas with 64 players on the field at once. When throngs of warriors collide in one hotspot, blood and body parts fly everywhere as flailing attacks hit their mark. It\'s an exciting kind of chaos that leads to humorous displays of gory dismemberment, crushing failures, and harrowing escapes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharging into the mess with blades swinging is a fun but often-suicidal gamble, and accidentally killing allies with wayward blows is an occasional nuisance. Fighting on the outskirts of bigger clusters leaves more room to build up a rhythm as you block, dodge, and trade blows with opponents, and a new Duel mode lets you explore this in greater detail with one-on-one battles in smaller confined arenas. It feels like the nuts and bolts of combat – both long-range and melee – have been tightened for the better, but some rough spots do pop-up in other areas. Bots, for example, make awful comrades. They sometimes cluster in groups at spawn points doing nothing but spin around at random. Fortunately, there are plenty of servers populated with human opponents to carve up instead.<br />\r\nThe absence of team objective-based maps like those found in the original is another disappointment, but new multi-team matches that allow all six factions to battle it out on a single map makes the standard run of modes a lot more entertaining. A broad range of match combinations let you conduct funny Pirates vs Ninjas throwdowns, for example, or even mix it up in red vs. blue bouts that let each player pick whatever faction they please. This diversity carries over to the map designs themselves, as each group also has its own home turf to fight it out across. From sandy beaches filled with caves to wintry villages caked in fresh snowfall, there are some cool-looking maps sporting ample nooks and crannies you can use to your advantage.',1386323099,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/screen2-610x343.jpg','published','basic_article',0),(112,'Plants vs. Zombies','It\'s not every third-person shooter that has me giggling as I shoot gatling peas at zombies dressed as football players. While Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare puts players in humorous settings with imaginative powers, it also offers a unique, hilarious shooter experience that both fans of the series and those shooting sunbeam lasers for the first time will get a kick out of. I recently got the chance to go hands-on with the game to test out one of Garden Warfare\'s multiplayer modes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore you hop into a multiplayer match, you select a plant or a zombie to play as. In my demo there were four base options for each side, but what I was surprised to find was that each character also has a wide variety of customization options available. Here, I could choose from a variety of humorous accessories, tattoos, hats, and organic elements for each plant or zombie. For example, I ended up giving my Pea Shooter character cucumber shades, a camo tattoo, and a top hat. Producer Brian Lindley explained that while there were only a few options available in this demo, \"There\'s going to be dozens and dozens more [in the final game].\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter you select a character and their outfit, you march into battle with a team in order to be the first side to net 50 kills. I only played on one map, Garden Center, but it was large enough to offer several strategic platforms and had a variety of rooftops and hiding places where you could pop out and decimate enemies. The map was also peppered with silly artistic touches, like doodles and graffiti on the walls that say things like \"Plants R Stoopid\" (I wonder who wrote that…). Lindley told us that the other nine maps available at launch will be in suburban neighborhoods, seaside towns, and more, but they all originate from the idea of playing in the backyard, and the developers went crazy from there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach plant and zombie comes equipped with three distinct abilities as well as a basic attack. The abilities are derivative of the attacks in other Plants vs. Zombies titles, but they come to life in new and creative ways here. For example, the Peashooter can root into place and use his Gatling Pea ability to unleash a rapid-fire attack, just like in Plants vs. Zombies 2. But rather than only being able to shoot down a line, you can now shoot multiple enemies until you\'re taken out or run out of ammo. The Sunflower, another memorable character from Plants vs. Zombies, can heal her allies and offers support to her teammates by dropping Marigold Pots around the map that heal anyone who comes near it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe zombies are familiar as well. The All-Star Zombie for example, (the one dressed as a football player) comes equipped with a heavy Football Cannon that fires out mini footballs, but he\'s got a few powerful abilities up his sleeve. He can use Sprint Tackle to charge enemy plants back, or he can send out an enthusiastic Imp super fan Zombie that explodes upon colliding with plants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut while the All-Star was entertaining, my favorite Zombie was the Engineer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Engineer comes equipped with a shotgun-esque Asphalt Cannon, but his two abilities I enjoyed the most were Jackhammer and Engineer Drone. Jackhammer is basically the Engineer\'s sprint ability, but rather than running fast, he hops up on his Jackhammer and quickly rides it around the map with his buttcrack hanging out as you go. The first time I saw it I laughed out loud, and it never got old. His Engineer Drone is a little zombie robot that you control and fly over the battlefield to try and drop air strikes on the enemy plants. Finding a group of clumped up plants and calling an air strike down upon them was incredibly satisfying. The Cactus Plant has a similar ability called Garlic Drone, and while the Engineer Drone drops fiery air strikes, Garlic Drone drops exploding popcorn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to your team trying to be the first to reach 50 kills, each plant and zombie has their own character progression as well. You earn experience by completing challenges throughout the match, and every character will have three challenges to overcome at any time. These challenges encourage you to use your character correctly, like getting 10 kills with an Engineer Drone or using your primary weapon on the Peashooter to kill five zombies. For completing challenges, you\'ll unlock new customization packs, as well as variations for the characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese variations are not only visually appealing, but they sometimes add new powers to the plants and zombies. The Scientist Zombie, for example, normally shoots purple goo at Plants, whereas the Marine Biologist Zombie shoots electric dolphins out of an eel-powered fish tank on his back. The Sunflower, who can fire rapid bursts of sunlight at her enemies, has an electric variation that allows her sunburst to electrically chain to other nearby enemies to deal more damage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf it all sounds like too much to take in at once, Lindley explained that there will be a \"Welcome Mat\" mode for new players still learning to play. \"Only players under rank 10 can get in and so it\'ll be a lot easier for players learning the game and still getting familiar with the characters can play with other players who are at that same skill level, so you won\'t get thrown to the wolves immediately.\" He also mentioned that with the game\'s co-op mode, which I didn\'t have a chance to try, people will be able to learn how to play alongside their friends, which he imagines some players will find appealing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Garden Warfare launches, PopCap plans to support the game with free bi-monthly DLC. \"One of the things we want to do is constantly be expanding the maps and modes and adding things for players to do as well as putting in new character items and different types of characters,\" Lindley said. \"That\'s definitely going to be one of our big focuses once the game launches, to drop lots of new content.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who may be intimidated by hardcore shooters, or for those just looking for some ridiculous fun, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare is looking like a fast-paced quality experience packed with a lot of extra goodies. And as far as Xbox exclusivity? A PC version has been confirmed and Lindley also mentioned that PopCap wants to, \"get the game in the hands of as many people as possible,\" so feel free to draw whatever conclusion you want from that…',1386323177,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/PvZ_GW_E3_Screens_04_WM_v3-610x343.jpg','published','column_article',0),(113,'BRAVELY DEFAULT','The JRPG may not be as influential or as prevalent as it once was, but it’s a genre that’s certainly not been wanting for quality or invention in recent years. The likes of Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story on Wii, Radiant Historia on DS and Persona 4: Golden on Vita are all strong examples, and in the last 12 months we’ve had stellar entries like Fire Emblem: Awakening and Pokémon X and Y on 3DS. Now you can add Bravely Default to the list - this expansive and inventive genre piece ends a great year for Nintendo’s handheld in fine fashion.<br />\r\nBravely Default’s greatest success is arguably its battle system, from which it takes its strange name. It revolves around a risk-reward mechanic that is wonderfully executed and offers many tactical possibilities. Pick the Brave option and you can take an extra go - up to four moves per turn – but doing so leaves you unable to move again for that number of turns. Pick Default instead, and you’ll simultaneously store up Brave Points while reducing the damage you take from enemy attacks – so if you wait three turns, you can launch multiple attacks and still be free to defend or heal yourself before your opponent launches their next offensive. It’s often better to mix and match, so you’ve always got at least one team member free per turn to protect others or heal; alternatively, you could use one team member to identify an enemy’s elemental weakness so that the ally moving next can imbue their sword with the appropriate magic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s tied into a Job system that allows you to assume a variety of different roles, each with different strengths and weaknesses and associated skills and special moves. Valkyries, for example, have acrobatic abilities and are adept at using spears and shields, while Black and White Mages are better with rods and staves respectively, and have more MP to play around with. Skills you learn in one Job, however, can be used to support you should you assume a new role, so should you wish to teach your party’s healer some offensive summons, or even change tack entirely and become a knight, you’re free to do so at any time. Defeat key enemies and you’ll gain a new Job, and with 24 in total to choose from the ability to combine any two, you\'ve got a huge range of possible tactics. You’ll need them, too, because the enemies in Bravely Default are smarter than your average JRPG grunts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you find yourself struggling, you can change the encounter rate, allowing you grind through random battles before facing hardier foes, or even reduce the difficulty level. There’s also the ability to use special drinks that temporarily stop time, essentially allowing you four free turns for one character. While your supply replenishes each 8 hours with your 3DS in sleep mode, you can also spend real money to top up on these SP drinks. The presence of micro-transactions may be off-putting to some, but they needn’t impinge on your enjoyment, as the game is balanced to function without them – they’re best viewed as a premium cheat to get past a difficult enemy quicker without needing to grind. And it’s not as if grinding is much of a problem. In most encounters you can simply use Brave four times per character and whizz through weaker foes. The ability to accelerate battle speed, meanwhile, is not only a considerate addition, but also quite comical, as you finish off enemies in a blur of rapid slashes and magical strikes on fast-forward.<br />\r\nThe battles are Bravely Default at its most inventive, but the story is more familiar (though still well told). Your four-strong party is formed early and you remain with them throughout, which keeps things more focused than RPGs with larger rosters. Tiz Arrior is a likeable teenager whose village has been swallowed up by a huge crater, killing his family and friends. He joins Agnès Oblige, a priestess of sorts who is tasked with reviving four faded crystals before the world descends into chaos. The pair are joined by Ringabel, an amnesiac ladies’ man who carries a mysterious book that seemingly predicts the future, and Edea Lee, an officer from the enemy army in pursuit of Agnès, who defects when she realises the horror of her actions.<br />\r\nThe narrative skilfully carries a sense of grand scale while stirring in quieter, more intimate moments, and the dialogue is by turns witty and overwrought. The vocal performances are decidedly mixed, yet the characterisation is strong enough to paper over the cracks. One early sequence in which Agnès is asked to participate in a beauty contest, however, is almost unbearably creepy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, when the story falters, you’ll be swept up by the splendour of the world. The character art is simple and striking, but the world itself is gorgeous. Its arresting hand-painted backdrops teem with detail and scintillating colour, from the bold shades of a flower village to the verdant beauty of a rustic hamlet. The soundtrack plays its part, too, marrying catchy battle music and strident themes with quieter, mournful pieces to accompany the more tragic moments.<br />\r\nThere’s a similar sense of refinement throughout. Even apparent gimmicks are worthwhile – an aside that asks you to rebuild Tiz’s home town eventually supplies you with new items and weapons, with Streetpass helpers and online friends reducing the time it takes to construct new shops. It even recognises when you haven’t encountered other players and throws you a bone with AI allies. You can register friends to summon during battles, and combine forces with the Abilink feature, which allows party members to use skills they may not have learned yet. That level of polish extends to the game’s weighty side quests, which are fully voiced and scripted stories that add considerable depth and detail.',1386323411,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/04/18/82952battle03jpg-acaf45_640w.jpg','published','column_article',0),(114,'STICK IT TO THE MAN','The fact that Stick it to The Man! is not a Tim Schafer game absolutely blows my mind (and believe me, I mean that in the best way). Its endearingly off-beat characters and quirky sense of humor could easily be mistaken for something straight out of Psychonauts or Grim Fandango. The basic setup even resembles Double Fine Productions’ latest effort, The Cave: though the 2D side-scrolling levels suggest it’s a platformer, the actual gameplay consists primarily of exploration, puzzle solving, and character interaction. You know, textbook adventure game stuff. It’s a formula we don’t see often enough, and one that Stick It executes with distinctive style, uncommonly excellent writing, and surprisingly self-assured game design.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nShortly after the opening credits, leading man Ray Doewood -- a nervous but likable schlub -- is struck by a mysterious government canister as it crashes to earth. Following a pretty hilarious tutorial dream sequence, Ray wakes to discover a giant pink spaghetti arm sticking out of his skull and quickly learns a shadowy chain-smoker known appropriately as The Man wants him dead. Or alive, either way. Luckily, his brand new extremity not only allows Ray to nimbly grapple and swing to certain points in the environment, it also lets him read people’s minds. Because what else would a crazy head-arm do?<br /><br />\r\nThe ensuing storyline careens wildly through countless madcap scenarios, from escaping an insane asylum on an inflated zombie whale to stealing an evil disco-dancing mob boss’s beautiful teeth. Even with all the over-the-top hijinks, the narrative remains compelling and cohesive (in a charming, cartoon-logic kind of way), and despite the campaign’s relatively brief five to six hour run time, the story still completes a full, satisfying arc. There’s very little replay value once you’ve heard all the jokes and solved all the puzzles, but the game at least manages to remain consistently funny throughout -- a huge plus considering most of the experience is devoted to eavesdropping on everyone’s thoughts.<br /><br />\r\nWhat’s truly impressive about Stick It is that it effortlessly develops its own distinct voice. The jokes don’t simply rely on tired internet memes or cheap, mindless gags. Instead, the humor emerges organically from the seemingly inexhaustible supply of imaginative characters like the conjoined triplets who also happen to be luchadors, or the ghost of a psychiatrist who’s obsessed with lobotomies. And while Stick It’s not afraid to get a little dark or surreal at times, the overall tone always remains pleasantly playful and silly. It’s really nice to find a game that’s capable of being clever but still doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s all supported by a soundtrack that’s both insanely catchy and perfectly complementary to the game’s other elements, as well as an impressive Paper Mario-esque visual style. The confidence and maturity of the overall vision is stunning, to say nothing of the expert execution.<br /><br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSweeter still, the gameplay design doesn’t trail far behind. Stick It adopts a Metroidvania approach to exploration, allowing Ray to move freely back and forth across the entire level as he gradually collects items and unlocks new paths. His ultimate goal is typically to escape the area, but in order to do so, he has to read minds, grab “stickers” out of people’s thoughts, and figure out exactly where to place those stickers. In one level, I had to grab some guy’s salty tears and give them to a chef so he could complete his meal, then give the meal to a different guy trying lure his pet gator out of a sewer pipe, only to take the gator’s jaws to a dog...and on and on. Of course, the game never spoon fed me the answers, I had to uncover the starting point and gradually unravel the intricate series of steps on my own.<br /><br />\r\nPuzzle solutions were always amusing and often unexpected, but no matter how farfetched they became, there was typically enough logic involved that I didn’t have to resort to mindless trial-and-error tactics. On the other hand, there were also no real “Oh, that’s brilliant!” moments like in, say, Portal. The sillier tone doesn’t necessarily lend itself to seriously challenging puzzles, but a little dose of cunning design could have elevated the experience even further. Still, the process never grows too predictable or routine, and the complexity does ramp up as you progress through the campaign. Plus, the non-stop humor and smartly-implemented cutscenes keep the momentum moving even in the absence of any real show-stopping puzzles.

It’s as good as Batman: Arkham City in most ways, having inherited an outstanding combat system, but it lacks interesting ideas of its own, and it’s missing the polish and attention to detail that makes Arkham City and Arkham Asylum great action games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIts name, “Arkham Origins,” is a flagrant misnomer - it may be a prequel, but this story is neither about Arkham, nor is it an origin story in any significant way. It’s more of a traditional Batman plot that retreads some of The Dark Knight’s most familiar themes over its roughly eight hours of main story content: a self-destructive insistence on working alone, and how far he’ll go to avoid taking a life - a concept the final battle cleverly toys with. It’s a respectable plot that even concocts a plausible reason for Batman to face so many villains all in one night – a $50 million bounty on his head. But it’s the kind of prequel that screams “What were we thinking when we killed off that incredibly popular character? Undo! Undo!”<br />\r\nThe actors standing in for long-time Batman and Joker voices Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill do a good job in emulating their predecessors - Troy Baker’s Joker, in particular, is close enough that I might not have noticed immediately if I weren’t listening for it. Conroy will always be Batman for me, but his understudy does well enough.<br />\r\nThis younger Batman already has all his signature moves and gear, flies a fancy plane, and is on a first-name basis with pretty much every villain but The Joker. So at the cost of really selling the idea that these events happen prior to the other two games, Origins keeps the foundation of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City’s amazing combat intact, including every gadget in one form or another. (Mr. Freeze’s absence from the rogue’s gallery means the cryo-grenades are now concussion or glue grenades.)<br />\r\nTwo new enemy types add a little extra variety, notably the martial artists who can counter your attacks. But the only substantial change is one of those things that’s awesome for the first time you use it, but quickly reveals itself as a bad idea. The Shock Gauntlets are among the last gear you unlock, which is good, because once charged (by hitting a few guys in regular combat) and activated, they let you completely ignore everything that makes combat interesting. Riot shields, stun batons, armored thugs – Batman just punches ‘em. They’re basically a win button, and the kind of thing that doesn’t work in a prequel because why would Batman ever get rid of them?<br />\r\nMeanwhile, in the stealth fights where Batman picks off armed thugs one by one, there’s another somewhat dirty-feeling win button: a remote grapple that strings up thugs without them even having to walk under a gargoyle. I found myself deliberately avoiding either of those gadgets, because I’m not in this to not fight criminals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven so, I could live in the challenge rooms for days, trying to string together the ultimate, uninterrupted flow that includes each of the dozen or so moves and gadgets in Batman’s arsenal. With the gamepad in the right hands (which every so often, mine are) it looks like elaborate fight choreography. And Predator still makes me feel like a ninja, particularly when playing in challenge mode where I can disable certain gadgets or enable other handicaps.<br />\r\nOut in the expanded and snow-covered open world, I found Gotham City beautiful but lifeless. In Arkham City, the excuse is that this part of town has been walled off and given to the criminals. Without that (admittedly far-fetched) scenario, the absence of any hint of civilian life makes Gotham feel eerily barren, especially next to Origins’ open-world peers and their populated streets. It may be the middle of the night on Christmas Eve, but streets teeming with nothing but decidedly un-jolly criminals are still weird.<br />\r\nThe northern half of the map, which is largely recycled from Arkham City, is connected to a new southern island by a tediously long bridge that your quest marker will frequently make you cross as you chase the next mission waypoint. The bridge stands out as crumby and inconvenient map design and I rushed to skip it with fast travel at every opportunity. Gotham is also full of annoying blockages that seem like Batman should be able to easily grapple or climb over, yet prove frustratingly insurmountable. Also, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U versions all suffer from framerate problems while gliding around the city. Those slowdowns are most pronounced on the Wii U, where I also ran into mid-game loading pauses. On PS3, I encountered audio glitches that got worse the longer I played – most noticeable during fast-travel animations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat constantly nagged at me, though, is that I spent the first few hours searching every corner of Arkham Origins for the DC Comics-themed Easter eggs that Rocksteady (the developer of the previous games) liberally stashed around the environments of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. But the most I ever saw outside of the Batcave was a Flying Graysons poster. That’s not to say there’s no incentive to explore – Gotham is, as ever, littered with collectable items, some of which are locked behind puzzles you have to gadget your way through – but they’re nowhere near as much fun as finding a hint that Scarecrow was here. Some of the love is missing here.<br />\r\nTechnically, there’s plenty of things to do around town, as it’s terrorized by a lineup of villains like The Penguin, Mad Hatter, and Anarky. Yet most of their missions boil down to the same “Go here, beat up a group of thugs, and deactivate/blow up a thing,” with variety limited to some of them having a timer on them. The one set that feels interesting are the radio towers, which must be disabled in order to unlock fast-travel locations. Those are mini-fortresses that integrate some tougher fights with light puzzle solving.<br />\r\nFor visual novelty, the new crime-scene investigations are impressive, and take the “zoom and enhance!” cliche to new extremes. Using the shoulder buttons to scrub through an augmented-reality reconstruction of events looks great, but it’s only barely interactive; all you do is find the next clue (hint: it’s the thing that’s highlighted for you) when prompted and scan it to get the next piece of the puzzle – no decision-making involved. It’s a better, showier use of Detective Mode than Asylum or City came up with, but still, it’s just for show. When using the Wii U Gamepad, you\'re encouraged (but not forced) to use the LCD as a viewfinder and control the first-person perspective camera with the motion controls instead of the sticks, which is unwieldy and gimmicky.<br />\r\nThe Wii U Gamepad is mostly useful as an always-on map, but outside of that Arkham Origins is strangely inconsistent about when it\'s used. The most notable omission being the Cryptographic Desequencer hacking tool. This is a gadget that looks and behaves much like the Gamepad itself, yet the Gamepad isn\'t used at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhere Origins does its best work are in its boss fights. With only one exception, they’re all very physical, direct encounters with supervillains. A few stray dangerously close to quick-time event territory, since Arkham games’ combat is prompt-heavy to begin with, but the spectacle of the unique animations makes them feel like a Batman fight should - most notably the Deathstroke duel. Others are simply mob brawls or stealth fights with a particularly dangerous foe mixed in, but the added challenge of having to stay on the move while fighting to avoid bombs, for example, brings something different to it.<br />\r\nThis is the first Batman game to have multiplayer (on all platforms except Wii U), and the eight-player mode feels like a first draft. Most of the time you’re playing a mediocre third-person shooter in which your three-man team competes for territory control points with a rival gang. The twist is that two other randomly selected players are Batman and Robin (who doesn’t appear in the campaign) picking people on both sides off using Predator mode moves and an extremely clumsy version of the single-player combat. Granted, it’s a fairly clever idea – I do like how when I’m fighting other thugs I have to be fearful of a hero sneaking up behind me, and when I’m looking up at the gargoyle perches trying to shoot down a hero a thug is likely to shoot me in the back. Plus, two heroes working together can dominate using classic Batman-uses-a-minor-as-a-diversion tactics. But given the unremarkable shooting mechanics, the multiplayer mode is a novelty that I wouldn’t expect to get more than a few sessions out of. Wii U owners aren\'t missing much here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE VERDICT<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBatman games are like pizza: even when they’re not very good, they’re still pretty good. Next to Arkham City, Arkham Origins is a bit of a disappointment in its lack of new ideas and use of win buttons, making it the least interesting of the trilogy. But as excuses to dive back into the excellent free-flowing combat and predator takedowns go, this story isn’t bad.',1386323863,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/06/11/baoe3batmanhelicopterjpg-30b9a2_640w.jpg','published','column_article',0),(116,'BEYOND: TWO SOULS','If you are the type who scrolls down a review to see the score before reading the text, know this first: I have never found assigning a number to a game so difficult. This is principally because Beyond: Two Souls takes the vision that writer/creative director David Cage and his team at Quantic Dream have held onto for so long - that interactive drama is the way to make gamers conditioned to meaningless violence feel something in the depths of our brittle souls - to unprecedented extremes. But Beyond is a game that made me feel too much like a passive participant, which made “playing” it a very confusing and unrewarding experience.<br />\r\nIndeed, if there was ever a game that suggested that Cage is a frustrated film director at heart, it’s this one. Beyond is an opus – a muddy and unfocused one, but an opus – packed with so much plot it feels like Cage has indulged his every whim and want in a single project. Unlike Heavy Rain before it, which dipped into silliness but was at least thematically consistent, Beyond’s only consistency is its focus on Jodie Holmes, the game\'s tragic heroine. She’s a character wonderfully realized by actress Ellen Page, who proves to be much of Beyond’s saving grace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJodie’s story is told in chapters out of chronological order across 15 years of her life. Beyond dances between these chapters: Jodie as a little girl, Jodie as a stubborn teen, Jodie as a young woman, Jodie as a little girl again, and so on. Her plight is driven by an unwanted tethering to a Poltergeist-like spirit she calls Aiden, whom you can also control depending on the circumstance.<br />\r\nThis flitting back and forth across multiple eras of Jodie’s life presents a couple of problems. It gives Beyond a schizophrenic, alienating feeling, and left me constantly trying to catch up with the progression of the narrative. Next to something like Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, this experiment with chronology feels unfocused; we are frequently thrust into deeply dramatic scenes that claw at our tear ducts far too early, before we’ve had the chance to fully invest in characters and their circumstances.<br />\r\nIn truth, Beyond’s plot would still feel disjointed even if it were told in order. Those familiar with Quantic’s previous works, most notably Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy, should not expect anything more focused here. The story takes us from horror (where the influence of Brian de Palma and Adrian Lyne is strong) to drama, action, and sci-fi, and it’s peppered with pulp: evil government conspiracies, supernatural enemies, and cackling bad guys from distant climates abound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCage has said in interviews that switching between genres and tone was a conscious choice, as nobody’s life is ever one flat note. But this is not a real life. This is a story about a girl and her ghost, and there is a reason filmmakers tend to stick with one genre or another: so as to craft a cohesive narrative. It is unfortunate there is no such discipline to be found here.<br />\r\nOccasionally, the plot does sing, and is dotted with moments that compelled me to continue playing. Cage’s best work comes out in the quieter, more human moments in his stories. Helping a teenage Jodie agonize over which music to choose at a party is one such moment; playing guitar on the streets in the middle of a bitter winter to earn enough money to buy food is another.<br />\r\nIn these scenes, Ellen Page has the opportunity to really make us care for Jodie. Page is an eminently likeable and capable actress and gamely takes on Cage’s crazy twists and turns, delivering her lines with nothing less than utter sincerity. The rest of the cast don’t always grant him the same favour, and frequently slip into broad theatrical strokes (“for the love of God, she’s a monster!”) because the writing grants them this luxury. Page – and yes, Willem Dafoe, although he’s simply doing his Norman Osborne routine here – knows when to downplay the crazy and put emphasis on those smaller moments. It is principally thanks to her, although Cage does deserve some credit here too, that I felt a lump in my throat at the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat’s missing, then, is the actual game built around this story. The system that allows us to interact with Jodie’s world has been streamlined for the better since Heavy Rain, and for the most part the action buttons - those much-maligned perpetrators of quick-time events (QTEs) - have been discarded. They’re replaced with more intuitive contextual interactions on the right thumbstick, or iPhone touchscreen if you choose to play with an even further-simplified control scheme.<br />\r\nAnything you can interact with in the world is indicated by a white dot; move the right stick in the direction that feels natural, and Jodie will do the predictable thing: pick up a doll, take a shower, sit down on a chair. There are the occasional instances of QTE prompts in moments of high tension, although they are relatively unobtrusive and feel natural within that context.<br />\r\nNavigating Aiden, too, is easy enough. You can switch to him when Jodie needs help, and a press of the triangle button will propel you into a first person view with a satisfying woosh. In his form you can pass through walls and ceilings to possess certain enemies (why some but not all is not explained), kill certain enemies (ditto), move certain items and occasionally feed Jodie flashbacks via a telepathic link so she knows how to progress. There is little coherency to the system, for Aiden’s usefulness is determined on a contextual basis by Quantic. Rarely did I feel as if I was using Aiden to progress based on my own intuition alone.<br />\r\nWhen he is required, Jodie will use one of a handful of verbal prompts: “help me Aiden,” “get rid of them, Aiden,” and so on. His goals tend to be blatantly signposted - a character to possess immediately to the left, an interactive bit of ghost dust in the room above. Further, you can’t always switch to him; it seems Aiden is a stubborn spirit. This simplistic gameplay and Aiden’s limitations are disappointing, particularly if one considers the potential for dynamic puzzle-solving interplay between Jodie and Aiden in co-op mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombat is the weakest aspect of Quantic’s new control scheme. Time slows down during physical fights, and you must move the right stick in the same direction as Jodie’s body to block or punch or kick. Her body isn’t always easy to read –and you only have a couple of seconds in which to do so – so frequently I found myself ducking instead of kicking, or moving backwards instead of forwards.<br />\r\nIt’s no matter: the outcome will be the same regardless. Jodie can get stabbed, beat up, pushed off the side of a building; she’ll always be fine on the other side. In circumstances where this invulnerability system is overtly nonsensical – when she gets shot for example – Aiden will simply heal her.<br />\r\nThis constant push and pull between our sense that we are impacting the story and the story itself has always been at the heart of everything David Cage has created, but it’s examples like these that highlight just how passive Beyond made me feel. There are, of course, choices: on Quantic’s whim, you can choose how Jodie responds in conversation, whether she’ll dance at a party or not, or take revenge on someone who has wronged her. But unlike the critical decisions you make in Heavy Rain, Beyond’s choices feel small, and the story will storm onward no matter how they are played out, never pausing to toss you a crunchy moral quandary to change its direction in any way that feels significant. It’s disappointingly unadaptable.<br />\r\nI can illustrate this by comparing two scenarios. In one, Jodie is preparing for a date: you have the ability to choose her outfit, what she’ll cook for dinner, if she cleans up her apartment or not, and so on. How she completes these tasks will affect the outcome of the date. In another, Jodie is instructed to kill a man. You have no choice in this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese restrictions are, of course, understandable from a technical perspective. Each time Quantic offers us a major decision, there is more game that must be made to accommodate, plus the developer only had so much flexibility with a solo protagonist. But it is unwise to build up our expectations of being able to choose our actions and then take that away from us where it feels most important.<br />\r\nIt should be noted that Beyond’s linearity also extends to general exploration, but this is an understandable decision on Quantic’s behalf; opening up its world would cause chaos with Beyond’s tightly scripted story. You still can bask in the beautifully detailed trappings of suburbia Quantic has carefully created, or the glistening sterility of a research base, or the vast desert plains of the Great Southwestern Nowhere. These stunningly realized backdrops are triumphs of technical craftsmanship, but they are indeed backdrops, built for looking at rather than touching; a thought that perhaps encapsulates this game in its entirety.',1386324042,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/03/25/bmuploads2013-03-191765jodieaiden08jpg-e21264_640w.jpg','published','basic_article',0),(117,'FORZA MOTORSPORT 5','“Cars. To some, they’re just transport; a convenient alternative to highly flammable dirigibles, or walking,” says Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson in Forza Motorsport 5’s pensive intro. But in a monologue not dissimilar to the one he provided to open Forza 4 Clarkson goes on to describe why cars are far more than this. He describes how they represent both the glory of technology and the essence of freedom. He explains how they mark the moments by which we define decades, as on-screen a set of keys is wedged into the palms of a grinning teenager.<br />\r\n“Cars are some of the most intoxicating, most beautiful things ever forged by mankind,” he muses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuperficially speaking Forza 5 is just looking to turn us on before we even turn a key, but once you’re inside it’s instantly clear that Forza 5 is here to accelerate Forza’s transition from a series that simply features cars to one that truly celebrates them. The cars here aren’t just thumbnails in a scrolling menu; every one has a history and a reason to admire it. Forza 5 clearly wants to be the defining cocktail of global car culture and it’s a philosophy that’s extends from Clarkson’s slightly wistful opening montage to deep within the guts of career mode. Thanks to a well-chosen bunch of unprecedentedly lavish car models and the help of all three hosts of the UK’s Top Gear, Forza 5 is a virtual love letter to every vehicle it contains. And while the overall track count teeters on the wrong side of thin and the lack of dynamic time or weather stings, it’s one that’s technically very hard to fault.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing just over 200 cars, Forza 5 is several hundred cars shy of Forza 4’s eventual count of well over 600. The important thing is that every car that did scrape into Forza 5 for launch deserves to be here. Iconic classics, from old-school European grand tourers to hulking US muscle and timeless Italian supercars to cult performance hatches and sedans. Cutting-edge current models, from affordable modern rides to today’s money-no-object hypercars. World-famous F1, GT, and touring cars and, for the first time, hardcore open-wheelers like the ludicrous Ariel Atom V8. It’s all wheat and no chaff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best place to dribble over them is in Forzavista mode, where they look absolutely remarkable. You can’t pop the hood on everything, but the level of attention paid to even the smallest of details can be downright astonishing. Explore every inch and you’ll find the cars modelled down to manufacturer stickers on the inner-edges of doors. The detail really is something else, from the speckled surface of a steering wheel in an enduring ’90s hatchback to the staggering crispness of the tiny labels accompanying the multitude of switches in a Le Mans Prototype. Forza 4’s Autovista mode already gave us an appetiser of this two years ago so the novelty is suppressed slightly, but the fact that every car can be so closely inspected is exceedingly cool.<br />\r\nOn track, things are equally impressive. Supremely realistic lighting slides over bodywork, casting impeccable shadows. Brake lights glow more realistically than ever. Flecks of rubber collect on the paintwork. Cosmetic damage doesn’t really handle massive accidents but small scrapes and nudges are well-translated to your car’s panels. You’ll even see specks of different coloured paint from rubbing against opponents.<br />\r\nIt’s not universally beautiful, though. Small effects like tyre smoke and the puffs of dust kicked up by cars putting a wheel off-track don’t amaze, and the rudimentary pit-stops look uncharacteristically shonky.<br />\r\nThe audio, however, is uniformly excellent, whether it’s the chirping of tyres under brakes or the throbbing of a helicopter overhead. And the engine notes? Well, they’re better than ever. Turn it up loud; that’s an order.<br />\r\nUnsurprisingly, the cars still handle as good as they look and sound. Better, in fact. It’ll certainly feel familiar enough to returning Forza fans, but there’s more nuance to how the cars shift about on their newly modelled suspension and more bite to the way tyres cling to the asphalt. The cars feel more distinct from each other than ever before too; the finesse required to thread a 600bhp, one-and-a-half metric ton V8 Supercar through The Esses across Mount Panorama is very different to the way you need to coax the thoroughly insane, rally-bred Ford RS200 around the famous Top Gear Hammerhead. Of course, it always has been – but here it feels more credible than ever. The way Forza 5’s cars communicate weight is tremendous.<br />\r\nThe Xbox One controller’s haptic triggers give you feedback on when your wheels are slipping under the throttle and losing grip under braking, and I was surprised at how much this adds to the driving experience.<br />\r\nIt’ll take you a while before you’re able to try all the cars because there’s been a change to the way we’re allowed access to them. Forza 5’s somewhat neutered free-play mode only lets you use your own garage cars or ‘rent’ one for free from a small selection, and driver levels no longer come with a reward car at every promotion. It’s a bit disappointing, although it does make you think harder about, and become more attached to, the cars you ultimately do buy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs always, cars can be upgraded, tuned, and painted. The best tunes and designs will be curated and suggested to players, but you can still manually search other players’ designs for the content you’re looking for. I honestly can’t say I was a massive fan of defacing my cars with the admittedly small selection of liveries available during the review period but you don’t have to apply a design. Thankfully, opponent designs can be switched off too, so if you prefer the traditional look over racing against a bunch of gaudy Hot Wheels also-rans you’re covered.<br />\r\nThe whole reason you’ll be at the mercy of other racers’ tastes in tribal vinyls, however, is because of Forza 5’s seriously cool new Drivatar AI. In single-player, Forza 5 will pit you against opponents which race according to the real-life driving behaviours of the Forza players they’re based on. Racing is a lot more dynamic and unpredictable as a result. Some Drivatar opponents take unconventional lines into corners, and many are happy to pound several cars wide into bends that regular, computer AI would have tracked around in a polite convoy.<br />\r\nYou can tune the Drivatar difficulty to be just right for your skill. You now just need to finish in the top three to earn gold completion so if you can repress your need to outright win every single race (and instead opt for a level of difficulty that’ll see you occasionally out-raced by the top two or three cars) you’ll be satisfyingly challenged every time you hit the track. As with turning off assists and refraining from the rewind feature, you earn extra XP for increasing the difficulty so it’s totally worth having it set where it’s hard to win but you’re still able to progress.<br />\r\nIt\'s also worth mentioning that even when you aren’t playing Forza 5, the AI based on your behaviour is, so each time you log in you’ll collect credits based on your Drivatar’s performance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForza 5’s track selection is also down from Forza 4, but the ones that are here are largely very good. New additions like Bathurst and Spa are genuine highlights, and (although the finish line at the former is in the wrong place) the absolute joy to be gleaned from bombing flat out into The Chase at Bathurst or Eau Rouge at Spa cannot be understated. These highly technical, world-class circuits are immensely fun to lap around. Importantly they mostly look as remarkable as the cars. Detail decreases the further off course you look but up close the imperfections on the track surface really sing, and the trackside objects and painted walls really do look realistically weathered.<br />\r\nDynamic time of day is again absent from Forza 5, as is changing weather; two omissions that are beginning to weigh heavily against the series. I will say the early morning sun in several of Forza 5’s tracks probably looks good in screenshots but feels a little overplayed here. I certainly got to a point where I was a bit tired of driving into a blindingly white orb and yearned to take on Mount Panorama at midday rather than 8am.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are just 14 track locations, so although most have more than one layout the final track count is arguably on the wrong side of light; you’ll generally find yourself hitting the same courses at least once in basically every race series. However, there’s no shortage of stuff to do on the tracks we do have. The varied racing series will keep you busy for a long time, and all of them are introduced by one of the Top Gear lads, who personally explain the significance of the participating cars. The credibility and humour these voiceovers bring to Forza 5 really works, whether it’s Richard Hammond beaming enthusiastically about classic US racing muscle or James May mildly appalled at the inclusion of a VW Beetle.<br />\r\nThen there’s the Rivals functionality, returning from Forza 4, which constantly rewards you with cash and XP for beating the player ahead of you and will again encourage many late nights chasing one more ghost. The standalone Rivals Mode features again too, with custom events hinged around certain tracks and cars. Of course, there’s also robust multiplayer for when you want to race real people rather than Skynet versions of them. The racing is fairly typical but it’s also highly customisable. If, like me, you still miss the endurance races, here\'s where you can set them up.',1386324190,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/Ariel_Atom-610x343.jpg','published','column_article',0),(118,'CRIMSON DRAGON','The idea of riding a dragon is inherently cool, but lackluster textures and dull sound effects were all I could see when playing Crimson Dragon. Instead of feeling like I’m controlling a powerful beast, this mostly on-rails shooter feels more like flying a kite. It’s not a bad shooter, but it comes with major caveats like a few frustrating encounters, repetitive environments, and heavy doses of RPG-like grinding.<br />\r\nWhen you’re just flying and shooting, Crimson Dragon handles fine, but doesn’t do anything special. The constant stream of dragon fire doesn’t feel powerful for the first five or six hours. Most stages play out like fun roller coaster rides, and the controls are traditional and intuitive. The camera helpfully moves around your dragon and keeps track of where enemies are, for the most part.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopers Grounding and Land Ho! integrated a fairly deep RPG upgrade structure where feeding dragons unlocks special moves. Each dragon has an affinity like Fire, Wind, Light, etc, but fortunately they aren’t pigeonholed to those types – so a fire-based creature can learn wind attacks, for example. The repetitive structure did start to wear on me before a new dragon was added to my stable, but at least that comes with the enticing possibility of discovering a bigger dragon with better stats and stronger abilities.<br />\r\nThe rider also has an independent leveling system that unlocks more dragons for purchase, but it takes a long time to land anything powerful. Replaying levels or starting new ones is the only way to increase a rider level. But the fact that Crimson Dragon reuses so many areas causes repetition to set in quickly. And you have to constantly revisit these areas in order to discover the required random drop that will let you into the next stage.<br />\r\nIt’s in the more open timed levels against bosses that things lead to frustration. These free-flying stages take you off the rails, but don’t give you the tools you need to navigate that way. You can speed up or slow down but never really stop or hover, so I’d constantly sail past a boss’ weak points over and over again… until time expired. I like the challenge of a difficult fight, but when it’s a clock that beats me instead of the enemy, it takes some of the fun out of battle. It helps a bit that maps are small, but a simple hover function would have made things much less frustrating.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the gold you earn from completing levels, you can hire Assistant wingmen to back you up in battle, but ultimately they feel like a flimsy waste of money. The big problem is that their stats aren’t good enough to be useful. Two dragons are better than one, but in timed missions and evasive bosses would get away because the two of us just weren’t strong enough to defeat it. Sometimes I would luck out and find a more capable wingman with a name like “Kickassius Clay.” Other times, they were so bad I wished a flying oversized enemy would put our miserable team out of commission. Usually, they did.',1386324285,'http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/06/14/crimson-dragon624jpg-50ec8a.jpg','published','column_article',0),(119,'DEADFALL ADVENTURES','I can\'t fault Deadfall Adventures for its style. It’s truly pretty, with some stunning architecture. But if Farm 51\'s FPS wasn\'t so striking, its mediocrity wouldn\'t be quite so obvious: the sumptuous art design is like a light that illuminates the clichéd level design and boring puzzles. The globe-trotting shooter already pales in comparison to its inspirations: it evokes Indiana Jones, Uncharted, Tomb Raider, and the Allan Quatermain books, but with all the skill and panache of hastily written school play. It\'s not witty enough to be a parody, nor is it not good enough to be a peer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuatermain is more than an inspiration, though: the handily out-of-copyright adventurer provides the historical clout for a story of ancient ruins, Nazis, Russians, and mummies. You\'re James Lee Quatermain, a whipless and witless descendant of the adventurer, hired to lead an expedition to find the Heart of Atlantis. He raids temples in Egypt, the Arctic, and Mayan jungles, because the ancient people he\'s trotting after have split the artifact and left it all over the Earth. I don\'t have a problem with that sort of hokey set-up, it worked for Indy and Lara which means it can and has led to surprising and wonderful things, but everything you\'d expect to happen to him in those settings does. Levers are pulled, mirrors realigned, and awful quips are tossed between James, his attractive female companion, Jen, and a German scientist who does exactly what you\'d expect him to about halfway through the story. There\'s even a mine cart chase sequence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\'d accept this traipse through tropes if the shooting was up to snuff, but it\'s not. It\'s not that the guns aren\'t well-realised: the WW2-era bangsticks deploy bullets with maximum efficiency, but you might as well be shooting at a hanging sheet for all the fun they are to blast at: they no-sell the bullets before falling like cautious stuntmen. They\'re split into two groups: Nazis and mummies. The Nazis are cowards, and will crouch behind crates and take pot-shots. It\'s one of those games with functional cover built out of perfectly placed crates, so you can tell where every shooter is going to hide before a shot is fired.<br />\r\nIronically, it’s the undead that bring some life to the gunplay: mummies can only be killed by a blast of light from a torch followed up with a few bullets. The old one-two punch is a lot more satisfying than chipping the health off a German elbow poking out from behind a box. It\'s at its best when you\'re fighting both sides at the same time, because the mummies and the Aryans don\'t get along. You can get some fun out of blinding the Germans and watching the undead maul them, but those moments are few and far between, and you\'re usually just fighting the tactless mummies or the nous-free Nazis (and later Russians) in isolation. And though neither side puts up much of a fight, there were a few times where I faced tediously overwhelming numbers only to die just before the autosave kicked in. Those deaths were often cheap, with a few instakill traps getting me. The one time I dared to touch water also proved immediately and bafflingly fatal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf all the disappointments in Deadfall Adventures, it\'s the puzzle design that\'s the most galling. That\'s partly because of the striking art: when you see the tumbled columns, the shafts of light, the vine choked Mayan temples, it\'s not hard to imagine the multi-staged Tomb Raider-esque challenges that could fill them. But instead, about 50% of the puzzles are so simple they almost come pre-solved, relying heavily on the tired theme of lining up some icons and then hitting a switch. There are others involving mirrors and redirecting light beams that at least take into account the space you\'re in, and a few tricks in later levels that ask you to do some vaguely Doctor Jones-style flame dodges, but those are the exception. It\'s all levers and symbols, crammed into a small part of an otherwise elaborately constructed world. It\'s such a waste to see doors with more thought put into the unlocking animation than in the method of unlocking.<br />\r\nMultiplayer is a ghost town. There are plenty of modes, with the usual mix of Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture The Flag, joined by solo and team-based Artifact Hunts. Though there are no players, I can confirm that the animated backdrop of the lobby at least makes a nice screensaver. I\'m not surprised that those people who\'ve experienced the single-player didn\'t want to share the experiences with the wider world, but if you did buy it you might get some enjoyment out of Survival. It’s a horde mode, and one that allows the players to set off traps and burn mummies together. Combo-ing might make up a little for the lame duck design, particularly one person leading the undead in front of a giant crushing device for the others to set-off. But even with rooms full of spiky traps, it’s unlikely to grab you for long. It’s just too uninspired.',1386324399,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/Deadfall-img2-610x343.jpg','published','column_article',0),(120,'BALDUR\'S GATE 2: ENHANCED EDITION','Thirteen years may have passed since the original release of Baldur\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, but I still remember pulling out the 263-page user\'s manual, feeling my eyes widen in intimidation at stats like “THAC0,” and chucking it to the side and jumping in without it. I don\'t regret it. Then, as now, Baldur\'s Gate II\'s stats will lead you down countless labyrinthine passageways if you let them, but there’s something ingenious about a game that uses an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons ruleset and still gives you at least a fighting chance of survival. In this new Enhanced Edition, Beamdog\'s clearly learned some lessons from its first attempt at enhancing the franchise last year, and its new content and built-in tweaks and conveniences render it a generally satisfying ride for newcomers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBG2EE even looks like the 2000 version, down to the cutscenes (which were sadly replaced in last year\'s Baldur’s Gate Enhanced Edition). Booting up the original reveals the extent of the work Beamdog has done here, as it was designed in the days when we drooled over resolutions in the neighborhood of 800x600. With the Enhanced Edition, however, BioWare\'s classic runs comfortably at today\'s resolutions, and supports the welcome ability to zoom in and out as you wish. Though the resulting pixelation from zooming serves as a brutal reminder of why BioWare originally intended to keep the camera fixed, the environmental visuals have held up well over the years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNumerous other tweaks abound. No longer do you need to hit Escape every time you wish to save; a new quicksave option allows you to prepare for foul ups without interrupting the pace of the action. Elsewhere, a new help menu provides a smidge of guidance for players who don\'t have the convenience of the aforementioned instructional tome, and a quick-loot option avoids the old hassle of endlessly clicking the screen to collect the spoils of battle. Beamdog also updated the Black Pits addition they designed for the first enhanced edition, which allows new players a way to just kill bad guys without worrying about the story. It still amounts to little more than a straightforward arena mode, but the enemies seem more challenging now and I once again found it useful as a makeshift tutorial for controlling the six members of my party in the main game.<br />\r\nConvenient additions all, but on its own it’s not enough for veterans to justify spending around double the cost of the original version (as found on vendors such as GOG.com), where a decade plus of mods and patches have already corrected many of its shortcomings. Instead, the real appeal of Beamdog\'s version for newcomers lies in the several hours\' worth of story delivered through four new characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree of them – the annoying wild mage Neera, the monk Rasaad yn Bashir, and the brooding half-orc Dorn Il Khan – reprise their roles from Beamdog\'s enhanced edition for the first Baldur\'s Gate, and the sequel\'s expanded abilities make them more immediately enjoyable than before. In the first outing, many of their adventures seemed brief, uninspired and even forced, but here each of their storylines span multiple zones and offer a handful of different resolutions.The content\'s stronger, too. Battles in the new characters\' questlines seemed uninspired when they appeared last year, but here they deliver some of Baldur\'s Gate II\'s most consistently challenging content.<br />\r\nEnhanced Edition also throws a new evil-aligned female thief named Hexxat into the mix. She\'s one of the best reasons to experience BGII:EE, particularly since her well-written story arc and its twist provide a compelling reason to walk on the dark side. Hexxat also brings with her the possibility of a same-sex romance, and indeed, Beamdog took a bold step here in restricting the relationship to female characters. Already modders are clamoring for a way to make her questline available to males, but it\'s nice for female characters to have a same-sex option aside from Anomen after all these years. This wealth of new story content is where Baldur\'s Gate II lives up to its \"enhanced\" moniker the most, and it\'s all handled so well that players approaching it for the first time likely won\'t be able to tell where the old game ends and the new content begins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSave, that is, for the bugs that pop up during these new missions. Hexxat and Dorn\'s quests seemed particularly glitchy, to the point that I took to making special saves before following their questlines in case I encountered missed triggers or noninteractive quest objects that a reload usually fixed. Actual progression roadblocks aside, the rough quality of some of the new content even shows up in low-resolution textures in a few new zones and occasional typos in the quest dialogue.<br />\r\nConsidering the hundreds of hours\' worth of content already in Baldur\'s Gate II, however, these are relatively brief intrusions in an experience that still manages to hold its own despite the widespread adoption of its model by numerous RPGs in the intervening years. That\'s also true of the equally impressive Throne of Bhaal expansion, which is included with the package. The story gripped me as much on this playthrough as it did the first time around thanks to the voice acting, which has lost none of its potency.',1386324489,'http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/11/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition-2-610x343.png','published','review_article',0),(121,'POKEMON X AND Y','Every so often, evolution takes a significant leap. Pokemon X and Y is smarter, better, and faster than its predecessors, but it’s the impressive online social features and fantastic new 3D look that make the latest game in the 15-year-old RPG series amazing. As long as you’re within the range of Wi-Fi, you’re never alone in Pokemon X and Y, and we finally have the tools to express ourselves over the course of this 35-hour adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch like its predecessors, Pokemon X and Y appeals to a wide audience, from veteran fans to timid newcomers by challenging them to become knowledgeable trainers or fill the up the encyclopedic Pokedex. Thanks to an impressive amount of depth from elemental-based combat, it manages to pull off this difficult task right from the start.<br />\r\nA lot of smart decisions went into Pokemon X and Y. The first big change is an opening that’s considerably faster-paced than the sluggish first hours of the previous games. In less than an hour, you’ll have access to a diverse roster of capable pokemon from current and previous generations, your first gym badge, and even roller skates! The significantly sped-up pace also means you’ll spend less time sitting in lobbies or fumbling through menus and more time in the action.<br />\r\nThis is the first fully 3D Pokemon game, and it’s made the transition beautifully, with some great art direction in its many characters. Take Charizard, for example – this fire-type pokemon has been intimidating since he first stomped onto the scene in the original games, but his new look is absolutely stunning. He quietly hovers in place looks large and majestic, dwarfing his old 2D look. At the other end of the spectrum you’ve got the hyper-cute Pikachu, whose adorable animations effectively sell his personality. And the all-new Mega Evolved versions look similarly impressive, with intimidating features such as the additional thorns and hair that give Mega Lucario a ferocious visual edge over its normal form.<br />\r\nJust as importantly, developer Game Freak has finally opened the door for unique avatars and creature customization beyond simply picking our gender. We can now choose a basic skin tone and dress up with a variety of nifty accessories. These simple tools finally give me the ability to distinguish myself from the thousands of other people playing, and that makes Pokemon a much more personal experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt needed to do something to make it feel different, because Pokemon X and Y’s story follows a predictable arc that’s very similar to previous games, albeit with a charming cast of four NPC friends this time. Sadly, the one-note design of these characters is still pretty disappointing for a predominantly single-player RPG. I know that it’s aimed at kids, but as a Pokemon fan for the past 15 years, I couldn’t help but wish for a story that appeals to fans of all ages.<br />\r\nAt its core, Pokemon’s gameplay core bores down to battling and trading, and both systems have been carefully refined over time. There are small improvements to note here though, like the ability to restore pokemon before they’re switched into battle. Although the tried-and-true formula is still largely the same, these small improvements are smart in that they remove unnecessary downtime between battles.<br />\r\nPerhaps the most significant change to combat is the role of Mega Evolutions, which will have a major impact on the way Pokemon battles are played. These special transformations can alter pokemon types, and those changes make battles much more strategic. Charizard’s and his Mega Evolution, for example, switches him from Fire/Flying to Fire/Dragon, which basically removes his weakness to Water. It adds a potential seventh option to your roster of six pokemon, and the possibilities increase dramatically.<br />\r\nGame Freak wisely imposed some limitations on that powerful upgrade: you can only summon a Mega Evolution once per battle, and not every pokemon can assume one of these altered forms. And there’s an unintentional limitation as well: while battles against humans feel more strategic, the trainer A.I. still doesn’t know how to react to or counter elemental weaknesses. So after a certain point in the campaign, a player with the right pokemon will steamroll through rivals in single-player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes Pokemon X and Y feel dramatically new and more modern are its forward-thinking online features. Specifically, the Player Search System, a communication tool that debuted in Pokemon Black & White, receives considerable upgrades that make playing together a much more graceful experience. You can quickly battle and trade at any time, or share helpful O-powers – think of them as unique buffs that enhance a stat like attack or evasion. You can also share all of that new customization. For instance, each trainer can share a brief video that shows off acquired creatures or general traits about themselves. It\'s a fun form of expression.<br />\r\nBut a lingering question remains for what will happen long-term in a post-Pokemon X and Y world: what impact will Super Training – a regimen of training that you can use to easily boost base stats – have on the multiplayer community? This interesting feature could potentially upend the balance at the heart of Pokemon. On the other hand, it makes the practice of boosting stats much more approachable compared to the grind of EV training. Only time will tell.',1386324638,'http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2013/08/28/pokemon-y-x624jpg-882d5f.jpg','published','column_article',0);
